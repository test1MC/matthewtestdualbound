        <p style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>M.100</b>: The application shall display a disclaimer regarding use of medication history retrieved via Surescripts.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt;">Sample Disclaimer: Certain information may not be available or accurate in this report, including items that the patient asked not be disclosed due to patient privacy concerns, over the-counter medications, low cost prescriptions, prescriptions paid for by the patient or nonparticipating sources, or errors in insurance claims information. There may also be a potential for false positive match if the patient’s demographics sent in the message have information similar to another patient in Master patient Index. The provider should verify the patient’s demographics and medication history with the patient.</p>
