        <p style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>R.219:</b> An automatic response for RxRenewalRequests shall not be sent back to the pharmacy. The exception to this requirement is for a customer that does not support Compound or Supplies. User review and approval/denial of the most recent version of the RxRenewalRequest is always required. When possible, use Approve or Approve with Changes rather than Replace. An Automated response for RxRenewalRequest shall not be sent prior to 72 hours after receiving the request.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt;">* Automatic response: A response that is generated systematically without allowing the receiver to review the request.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt;">* Automated response: A scheduled automated response is sent when the request is not responded to and the receiving system is informing the sending system that the request has not been addressed. The automated response must include a Denial Reason for the response.</p>
