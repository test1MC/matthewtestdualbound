        <p class="BodyText1Indent">4.4 The application shall make distinctions between all formulary statuses. (For example, Non-Formulary, On-Formulary/Preferred Level 1 and On-Formulary/Preferred Level 3 must be distinctly identified.)</p>
        <p class="BodyText1Indent" style="page-break-before: always;">4.5 During the prescription writing process and prior to the summary screen, the application shall display without user action: formulary status, all coverage factors, and all copay factors for all pharmacy types provided for a drug at the drug name/strength/dosage form level. These concessions are allowed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>An indicator that coverage factor(s) applies. User action on this indicator presents all the coverage factors in their entirety.</li>
            <li>Abbreviated copay displayed that user action shall display all copay factors for all pharmacy types in their entirety. Note that copay must not be displayed for a drug that is not reimbursable (status zero). The abbreviated copay displays:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>At least two pharmacy types in this precedence order: Any &gt; Null &gt; Retail &gt; Mail Order &gt; Specialty &gt; LTC.</li><li>Values and qualifiers to abbreviate all of the copay details. Examples include combinations of:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li><p>T1/3 (indicates Tier 1 of 3)</p></li><li><p>$20+10% (indicates $ amount is first term, followed by %)</p></li><li><p>30D (indicates 30 days supply)</p></li><li><p>“…” (indicates min/max copay amounts or more info available)</p></li></ol></li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText1Indent">4.6 If the application displays formulary status for a drug at a level higher than drug name/strength/dosage form, the formulary status shall be the most preferred status of all strengths and dosage forms of that drug.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1Indent">4.8 The application shall display a formulary status of unknown for all drugs when the eligibility request does not return an eligible coverage and the application uses no other formulary sources.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1Indent">4.9 The application shall display a formulary status of unknown for all drugs when there is no formulary status list ID or corresponding formulary status list for the coverage selected.</p>
