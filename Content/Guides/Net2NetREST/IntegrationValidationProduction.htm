        <p class="BodyText1">The customer is invited to a Surescripts education session, receives network guides/requirements documentation, and their account is set up to access the Surescripts staging environment.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The timeframe of the project can vary depending on your resource allocation for the project.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The integration process includes testing to ensure that the customer meets all Surescripts' requirements. Surescripts provides a detailed plan outlining the necessary milestones for integration and moving into production. Customers will be required to pass message validation prior to transitioning to production.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Message validation focuses on message format, and when appropriate, application workflow and display in accordance with Surescripts implementation guides and the associated Application Certification Requirements (ACR) document noted in <MadCap:xref href="DocumentReferences.htm">Document References on page 1</MadCap:xref>. By holding all customers accountable for meeting the ACRs, our customers can send and receive the highest quality messages as e-prescribing and clinical messaging continue to progress overall as an industry.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">In addition, Surescripts message validation focuses on patient safety, efficiency of the electronic prescribing process and ease of use by end-users.</p>
