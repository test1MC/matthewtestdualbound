        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts’ goal is efficiency and consistency across the network so that all customers can meet the highest measures of patient safety, end-to-end reliability, and quality. To maintain this network integrity, Surescripts</p>
        <ul>
            <li>initiates a remediation process for identified compliance issues,</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>conducts scheduled and ad-hoc compliance checks of all customers transacting on the network, and</li>
            <li>monitors customers in production to ensure all network customers remain in compliance with network requirements and contractual terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">Customers agree to notify Surescripts when they have altered, reconfigured or disabled any portion of a connected software product or module before moving such changes into production to ensure the network functions appropriately for all connected. In those instances, Surescripts will work with the customer to perform a timely message validation, if necessary.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The guide is not intended to ensure compliance with state and federal law. In accordance with customer’s legal agreement with Surescripts, each customer is responsible for conducting its own due diligence to ensure compliance with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, local and state laws and regulations in which the customer’s application is deployed.</p>
