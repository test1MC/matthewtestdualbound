        <p class="BodyText1">Net2Net REST is used to exchange <span style="font-style: italic;">Clinical</span> messages. A <span style="font-style: italic;">Clinical</span> message in the context of this guide is a message delivered to and from authorized customers on the Surescripts network (as such may be renamed from time to time by Surescripts) that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Contains clinical or administrative information about a specific patient used for health care payment, treatment, or operations; AND</li>
            <li>Is not structured except to the extent necessary to transmit an attachment and as necessary for address fields; AND</li>
            <li>Is not limited to a specific message type or use case; AND</li>
            <li>Does not require message type or use case-specific workflow integration into the Electronic Health Record (EHR).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText1">By implementing the Net2Net REST standard, Surescripts enables our customer to meet Meaningful Use Stage 2 (MU2) requirements. Surescripts messaging meets the transport and security specifications outlined in the Office of the National Coordinator’s (ONC) Health Information Technology: Standards, Implementation, Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology, 2014 edition.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">This Surescripts Net2Net REST Implementation Guide was created to assist customers in developing and transferring messages needed to provide secure information exchange between providers. The audience for this document includes any customer responsible for developing a system interface to the Surescripts network using Net2Net REST.</p>
