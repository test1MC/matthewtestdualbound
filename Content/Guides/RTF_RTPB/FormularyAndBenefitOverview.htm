        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="Section 1: "><a name="top"></a>Formulary And Benefit Overview</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.1 "><a name="About"></a>About Formulary</h2>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">RFS utilizes NCPDP Formulary and Benefit 3.0. Provider vendors currently using Formulary 1.0 will need to make the required changes to handle Formulary 3.0-based RFS data.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Formulary and benefit data can consist of the following types: Formulary Status, Payer-specified Alternatives, Coverage Information, and Copay Information.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">A medication formulary is a list of prescription medications published by a health plan, pharmacy benefit manager or payer. Each medication within a formulary is assigned a "formulary status", which is an indicator of a formulary publisher’s preference for the medications on the formulary relative to other medications in the same or a related therapeutic class. Formulary publishers periodically publish revisions to their medication formularies as new clinical and cost issues influence their preferences.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.2 "><a name="RFS"></a>RFS Introduction</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">During the prescribing process, provider vendor systems typically use the information retrieved through the RFS workflow to inform prescribers of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medications that the patient’s benefit plan considers to be “on formulary” (Formulary Status), and alternative medications for those which are not preferred (Alternatives);</li>
            <li>Limitations that may impact whether the patient’s benefit will cover a medication being considered (Coverage);</li>
            <li>The copay for one medication option versus another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The cross reference function that is part of the standard is not explained in this guide because it is not supported in Surescripts’ business model, since eligibility check is always performed prior to the formulary and benefit check.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.3 "><a name="Formular"></a>Formulary and Benefit Summary Information Model</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.3.1 "><a name="Formular2"></a>Formulary Status</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Formulary status is defined by using a simple, low-to-high scale. Medications with a lower formulary status are considered less preferable by the payer; those with a higher status are more preferable.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Payers determine a medication’s formulary status by considering its efficacy and value compared to other medications in the same therapeutic class (a grouping of medications known to be effective for a particular diagnosis). Those medications with a higher rating obtain a higher formulary status.</p>
        <p>Formulary Status:</p>
        <p>U = Unknown Status</p>
        <p>1 = Non-Formulary</p>
        <p>2 = On-Formulary/Non-Preferred</p>
        <p>3 - 99 = On-Formulary/Preferred (higher number means "more preferred")</p>
        <p>0 = Non-Reimbursable (used to flag medications that the benefit does not cover at any level</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.3.2 "><a name="Payer-Sp"></a>Payer-Specified Altervatives</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">As discussed above, medications with a higher formulary status than others of the same therapeutic class are considered to be “preferred alternatives” to those with lower ratings. Therefore, provider vendor systems can identify preferred alternatives by comparing the status of medications within a therapeutic class.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Payers can explicitly state alternatives for specific medications. These payer-specified alternatives are communicated in Alternatives lists, which contain the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Source medication: the off-formulary medication</li>
            <li>Alternative medication: the preferred alternative</li>
            <li>Alternative medication preference level: if there are multiple preferred alternatives, the payer’s order of preference (higher number equals greater preference)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.3.3 "><a name="Coverage"></a>Coverage Information</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Coverage information qualifies the conditions under which the patient’s pharmacy benefit covers a medication. For instance, a medication may be covered only for patients under a certain age, or of a certain gender. Other medications may be covered up to a certain quantity. Payers can communicate the following coverage factors to provider vendor systems using the file load:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prior authorization requirements</li>
            <li>Step therapy requirements</li>
            <li>Step medications</li>
            <li>Age limits</li>
            <li>Gender limits</li>
            <li>Quantity limits</li>
            <li>Product coverage exclusions</li>
            <li>Resource links</li>
            <li>Text messages</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">A payer may send multiple quantity limits, step medications, text messages and resource links for the same medication.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.3.4 "><a name="Copay"></a>Copay Information</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Copay information describes the “cost to the patient” - the extent to which the patient is responsible for the cost of a prescription. The specification supports multiple ways to state this cost, including flat dollar amounts, percentages, and tier levels. Payers may use one, or a combination of these options.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">For instance, a flat $10 patient copay may apply to one drug, and a 15% copay may apply to another. One payer may state copay exclusively in terms of copay tiers, where lower tiers mean a lower patient copay. The publisher determines what is appropriate to send, based on their benefit design.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Payers can communicate the following copay terms to provider vendor systems using the file load:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flat copay (dollar amount)</li>
            <li>Percentage copay</li>
            <li>Combination flat / percentage</li>
            <li>Copay tier (tier of given medication versus the number of tiers)</li>
            <li>Minimum and maximum copay</li>
            <li>Days supply per stated copay</li>
            <li>Copay differences by type of pharmacy</li>
            <li>Copay specific text message (via the text message Coverage list type)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1"><b style="font-style: italic;">Summary-level copay</b>. Often, a class of medications will receive the same copay (generics, for example). Payers can state a summary-level copay rule, based on a medication’s Formulary Status and its type (Branded, Generic, Over The Counter, Supply, or Compound). Any medication with the characteristics stated in the summary-level rule receives the copay defined in the rule.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1"><b style="font-style: italic;">Medication-specific copay</b>. Exceptions to these summary-level rules will also frequently exist. To accommodate these exceptions, Payers can provide medication-level copays. These copays apply to specific medications, as identified with one of the supported medication identifiers or a representative 11-digit NDC ID.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.3.5 "><a name="Roll"></a>Roll Up</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Formulary information is provided to Surescripts by all PBM/payers customers. This data identifies formulary status, coverage, and copay data for the payer’s active members. Today, most PBM/payers are providing formulary files at the NDC-11 packaged medication level. All provider vendors prescribe at a dispensable medication level (medication name, form, and strength). In order to display formulary correctly the data must be rolled up to a dispensable medication level. This process involves Surescripts performing this roll-up feature before the data is supplied to the clinical vendor. Surescripts will select a representative NDC from the drug database vendor and roll all formulary information to this level.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.4 "><a name="Medicati"></a>Medication Identifiers</h2>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.4.1 "><a name="Represen"></a>Representative NDC</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Since prescribing systems typically operate at a label name level of specificity, it is not always necessary to supply all NDCs that tie to a given label name. In order to reduce the size of the formulary and benefit files, it is possible to use one or a subset of representative NDCs to define a category of medication. A representative NDC is an 11-digit NDC code that depicts a category of medication regardless of package size and manufacturer/labeler. In order to maximize the opportunity that the selected NDC exists among the various medication files, a representative NDC should not be a repackaged NDC, obsolete NDC, private label NDC or unit dose NDC unless it is the only NDC available identifying that category of medication.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.4.2 "><a name="RxNorm"></a>RxNorm</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">RxNorm provides standard names for clinical medications (active ingredient + strength + dose form) and for dose forms as administered to a patient. It provides links from clinical medications, both branded and generic, to their active ingredients, medication components (active ingredient + strength), NDC codes and related brand names. RxNorm links its names to many of the medication vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and medication interaction software. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.</p>
