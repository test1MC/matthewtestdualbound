        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc443909588"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">PBM/payers use the ID Load message to provide Surescripts with their member roster to populate the Surescripts Master Patient Index (MPI). Surescripts uses these files from the PBM/payers to establish uniqueness for individuals across PBM/payers. Surescripts’ search process uses demographics to identify a patient and then uses the PBM/payer's unique member ID to communicate with the PBM/payers. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts responds to PBM/payer ID Loads with a Member Directory Response File indicating the status of each load, including details at both the file and detail level. Information provided by Surescripts indicates if a file loaded successfully, loaded with errors or was not loaded at all. Affected records are detailed in the response file which indicates the specific reason each line had an error or warning.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts will also provide statistical data about the processing for a given Delimited File received from a PBM/payer (not provided for those that submit flat files). The Member Directory Response Summary File will allow PBM/payers new insight into the processing of MPI files, and will allow them to better determine whether all of the records sent to Surescripts were loaded as expected.</p>
