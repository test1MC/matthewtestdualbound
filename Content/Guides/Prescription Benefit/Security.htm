        <p class="BodyText1">Each customer must ensure that appropriate security measures are in place within its scope of operations to the extent of its interface with Surescripts and Surescripts’ systems and data. These security measures must be designed to protect against fraud and abuse and to maintain patient confidentiality.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Each customer must provide a Surescripts Trading Partner ID (ISA06 for X12) and password (ISA04 for X12) in all messages and a static network path (IP address). Surescripts will only allow message connectivity from the customer specified network path. Provision of an otherwise-valid ID and password from a network path not assigned to the customer will result in rejection of the message, and will be logged as a potential security violation.</p>
