            <li>Based on customer-to-customer contract relationships and the permissions granted by the Formulary Publisher on the Distribution List, Surescripts makes the appropriate subset of formulary and benefit lists available on the WebDAV server for Formulary Retrievers to download.</li>
            <li>The Formulary Retriever checks the WebDAV server on a scheduled basis to determine if there are new or updated formulary and benefit lists available.</li>
            <li>The Retriever downloads the formulary and benefit lists to their system and makes them available to prescribers via their point-of-care (POC) application.</li>
            <li>During or before a patient’s office visit, a prescriber sends an Eligibility Request (270) to verify the patient’s health plan information, prescription benefit, and formulary information. The Request is routed through the system application to Surescripts’ Master Patient Index (MPI) for processing, and then on to respective PBM/payer(s) for processing. Refer to the Eligibility section for more information on this process flow.</li>
            <li>The patient’s Formulary ID, Alternatives ID, Coverage ID, and Copay ID are contained within the Eligibility response (271) sent back from the PBM/payer(s). The POC application links these IDs from the patient’s Eligibility response with the corresponding lists. </li>
            <li>During the prescribing process, the physician views patient formulary and benefit information within the POC application to verify that a particular medication is on the patient’s formulary and covered under the patient’s plan. If not, the prescriber can view “preferred” alternative drugs within that medication’s therapeutic class.</li>
