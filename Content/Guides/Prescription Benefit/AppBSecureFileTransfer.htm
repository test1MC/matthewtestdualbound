        <h1 class="Appendix1">Secure File Transfer</h1>
        <p>Surescripts supports the Secure FTP&#160;method for file transfer. </p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold" style="font-size: 12pt;"><a name="File"></a>File Processing Guidelines</p>
        <p>The files received by Surescripts must be in an ASCII line-feed terminated format. Typically, the file transfer methods will inherently perform character set and record termination translation.</p>
        <p>The maximum file size a customer should send to Surescripts is 1 GB. If a customer needs to send a file larger than 1 GB, they should notify Surescripts to ensure we will be able to process the file.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Compression should be used when possible while sending files to Surescripts. The preferred file type is .gzip, but other supported file types are .zip and .bzip.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold" style="font-size: 12pt;"><a name="Secure"></a>Secure FTP</p>
        <p>The Surescripts Response File naming convention will closely match the file name as transfer to Surescripts, with the addition of a timestamp value appended. Response files can be pulled by the customer using client software that is compatible with the Surescripts Secure FTP Server. If the customer has a compatible Secure FTP server, Surescripts can optionally push Response files to the customer's Secure FTP Server. Contact your Integration Project Manager for more information on the Secure FTP&#160;process.</p>
