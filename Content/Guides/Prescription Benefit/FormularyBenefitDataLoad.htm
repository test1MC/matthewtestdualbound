        <p class="BodyText1">During the prescribing process, provider vendor systems typically use the information retrieved through the Formulary and Benefit Data Load service to inform prescribers of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drugs that the patient’s benefit plan considers to be “on formulary” (Formulary Status), and alternative medications for those which are not preferred (Alternatives);</li>
            <li>Limitations that may impact whether the patient’s benefit will cover a drug being considered (Coverage);</li>
            <li>The copay for one drug option versus another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Provider vendors should refrain from displaying unnecessary information to prescribers, (e.g. NDC numbers, Formulary IDs, Coverage IDs, PBM Unique Member IDs etc.).</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">This section provides an overview of the information that can be communicated using the Formulary and Benefit Data Load service. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The prior authorization function that is part of the standard is not explained in this guide. The PA lists are not complete in this version and NCPDP has adopted specific messages to handle prior authorization work flow. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The cross reference function that is part of the standard is not explained in this guide because it is not supported in Surescripts’ business model, since eligibility check is always performed prior to the formulary and benefit check. </p>
