        <ol>
            <li>The Formulary Publisher develops their formulary and benefit file layout according to Surescripts’ standard Formulary and Benefit Data Load specification. </li>
            <li>The Formulary Publisher sends Surescripts a formulary and benefit file on a defined schedule that contains one or more of the formulary and benefit list types (e.g. formulary status and/or alternatives). The Formulary and Benefit Data is electronically transmitted to Surescripts via the selected file transfer method as a single physical file.</li>
            <li>Surescripts performs a physical validation of the file. </li>
            <li>Surescripts sends the Formulary Response File back to the Publisher indicating the Formulary and Benefit Data load status. The Response file indicates any errors encountered in the load process.</li>
            <li>The Formulary Publisher provides Surescripts with a Formulary Distribution List. The Formulary Distribution List indicates which customers have access to which formulary and benefit lists.</li>
            <li>Surescripts separates the file into individual formulary and benefit lists, processing each with its own list identifier. If there are no errors the lists are loaded into the database.</li>
