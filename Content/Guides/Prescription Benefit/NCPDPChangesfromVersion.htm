        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc443909654"></a>NCPDP Changes from Version 1.0 to 3.0</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">The definition of the value “03” in Product/Service ID Qualifier was changed to National Drug Code (NDC) to match the July 2007 External Code List (ECL). A new Product/Service ID Qualifier “36” (Representative National Drug Code (NDC)) was added.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">External Code List values were removed from the data elements with a note to see the NCPDP External Code List. Values remained where the field was constrained in the implementation guide.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">To provide a dependable base of information for Formulary and Benefit transmissions, the Formulary Status List is now required (section “Formulary Data Overview”). Additionally, the Formulary Status List Header provides fields that allow the sender to specify a default formulary status for non-listed drugs. In some cases, this is all the information that is necessary to describe the formulary. Verbiage was added to allow omission of Formulary Status Detail records when the non-listed formulary policies are used exclusively to convey the drugs’ formulary statuses in section “General Structural Overview” and “Formulary Status List”. Minor clarifications were made in sections “High-Level Processing Examples” and “File Processing Options”.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The Classification List and references to it (such as Drug Classification Information) has been removed due to lack of use. The Classification ID has been removed from the Cross Reference Detail.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Coverage Information Detail – Medical Necessity (MN) was also removed. Coverage Information Detail – Resource Link – Summary Level (RS) has been removed.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Formulary Status value 2 was clarified to On Formulary/Non-Preferred. Value 3-99 was clarified to On Formulary/Preferred. The statement “If 2 or less is sent – the provider vendor will need to check therapeutic alternatives (whether from the alternatives file or created on the fly)” was added.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Section “Coverage Information” added Text message support. The following has been clarified from “The file load also enables payers to specify a single coverage-related text message for each drug” to “A payer may send multiple quantity limits, step medications, text messages and resource links for the same drug.”</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Section “Copay Information” added a bullet about Copay specific text message.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The following fields now reference RxNorm:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product/Service ID (407-D7)</li>
            <li>Drug Reference Number (915-B6)</li>
            <li>Product/Service ID – Source (962-HY)</li>
            <li>Drug Reference Number – Source (919-CS)</li>
            <li>Product/Service ID – Alternative (958-HU)</li>
            <li>Drug Reference Number – Alternative (917-B8)</li>
            <li>Product/Service ID – Step Drug (960-HW)</li>
            <li>Drug Reference Number – Step Drug (921-CU)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">RxNorm Code and Qualifier are no longer designated for future use.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Coverage Information Detail – Coverage Text Message –</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The field Message – Short (942-GP) and Message – Long (941-GN) comments have been modified.</li>
            <li>The field Text Message Type (A46-1S) has been added.</li>
