        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc443909607"></a>Representative NDC</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Since prescribing systems typically operate at a label name level of specificity, it is not always necessary to supply all NDCs that tie to a given label name. In order to reduce the size of the formulary and benefit files, it is possible to use one or a subset of representative NDCs to define a category of medication. A representative NDC is an 11-digit NDC code that depicts a category of medication regardless of package size and manufacturer/labeler. In order to maximize the opportunity that the selected NDC exists among the various drug files, a representative NDC should not be a repackaged NDC, obsolete NDC, private label NDC or unit dose NDC unless it is the only NDC available identifying that category of medication.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc443909608"></a>RxNorm</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">RxNorm provides standard names for clinical drugs (active ingredient + strength + dose form) and for dose forms as administered to a patient. It provides links from clinical drugs, both branded and generic, to their active ingredients, drug components (active ingredient + strength), NDC codes and related brand names. RxNorm links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.</p>
