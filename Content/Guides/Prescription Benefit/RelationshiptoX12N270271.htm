        <p class="BodyText1">All eligibility inquiries and responses sent to Surescripts by customers must comply with the X12N standard for eligibility for a health plan mandated under HIPAA by the Department of Health and Human Services (the "270/271 Implementation Guide"). The descriptions in this section of 270 transactions and the 271 transactions clarify the information that Surescripts expects to be included in 270 transactions and 271 transactions exchanged with Surescripts. Nothing in these Specifications are intended or shall be deemed to: (a) change the definition, data condition, or use of a data element or segment in a HIPAA-mandated standard; (b) add any data elements or segments to the maximum defined data set of a HIPAA-mandated standard; (c) use any code or data elements that are either marked "not used" in the 270/271 Implementation Guide; or (d) change the meaning or intent of the 270/271 Implementation Guide.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The guidelines for data messaging interfaces provided in this document are tailored to the needs of Physician System and PBM/payer customers related to prescription drug benefits and are a subset of the X12N 270/271 standard. The X12N 270/271 standard covers a great number of other business scenarios that are not described in this section; however, Surescripts will support the minimum requirements of the X12N 270/271 transaction. See Section 1.4.7 of the 270/271 Implementation Guide (“Implementation Compliant Use of the 270/271 Transaction Set”). </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Even though Surescripts has implemented a subset of the X12N 270/271 standard, customers should be able to handle receiving all the segments, elements and related codes contained in the HIPAA X12N 270/271 standard. Refer to the  <MadCap:xref href="DocumentReferences.htm">Document References</MadCap:xref> for the exact reference guides needed.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If a provider vendor's customer submits an eligibility request that does not comply with the X12N 270/271 transaction standard, Surescripts will return a 999 response. If a Physician System customer submits an eligibility request that complies with the X12N 270/271 transaction but contains information that is unexpected by Surescripts, Surescripts will return a 271 response based on the information received by Surescripts that was expected, but the response may include AAA segments if insufficient information expected by Surescripts is submitted to generate a meaningful response.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If a PBM/payer customer submits an eligibility response that does not comply with the X12N 270/271 transaction standard, Surescripts will return a 999 response to the PBM/payer. The response to the PBM/payer should be responded to with an ACK. If a PBM/payer customer submits an eligibility response that complies with the X12N 270/271 transaction but contains information that is unexpected by Surescripts, Surescripts will pass the response to the requesting prescriber system customer. However, PBM/payer customers should be aware that such responses may not be understood or usable by the recipient prescriber system customer.</p>
