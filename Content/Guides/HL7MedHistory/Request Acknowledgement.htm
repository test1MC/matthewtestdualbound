        <p class="BodyText1">The HL7 Acknowledgement is utilized to inform the sender that the message has been received and accepted. Surescripts will submit a synchronous general acknowledgment in response to the ADT message indicating that we have received the message, understand its contents, and can process it further. Similarly, participants will submit a synchronous general acknowledgement to Surescripts after they accept an ORU or RDS message.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts performs the following checks before an acknowledgment is returned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security – Surescripts will validate the participant ID located in MSH-3 and the password contained in MSH-8.</li>
            <li>Format – Surescripts will attempt to parse the required information from the message. If the format is incorrect, this step may fail. These checks include the verification of the MSH-9 message type, MSH-12 version ID, and the MSH-11 processing ID fields.</li>
            <li>Environment – Surescripts will insure that the transaction is in the proper environment: test or production.</li>
            <li>Authority – Surescripts will insure that the sender is authorized to send this request and has a contract with Surescripts for a MEDS response.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">Once these checks are performed, an acknowledgement, with an error if necessary, is returned to the sender.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts participants need to determine the appropriate amount of checks they will perform before they send an acknowledgment in response to the ORU or RDS messages.</p>
