        <p class="BodyText1">An electronic connection between payers, prescribers, and pharmacists is essential to reducing costs and improving the safety and efficiency of the prescribing process. Patients can feel confident knowing their prescribers are empowered to make the most clinically appropriate and cost effective treatment decision at the point of care.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts certifies software used by prescribers, pharmacies, and payers/PBMs for access to the three core services – Prescription Benefit, Medication History, and Prescription Routing Services.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Prescription Benefit</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts is working with the nation's pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and payers to offer prescribers access to their patient's Prescription Benefit information in real time during an office visit. The Prescription Benefit service puts eligibility, benefits and formulary information at a prescriber’s fingertips at the time of prescribing. This enables prescribers to select medications that are on formulary and are covered by the patient’s drug benefit. It also informs them of lower cost alternatives such as generic drugs and ultimately ensures that the staff in the pharmacy receives a “clean” script. Unnecessary phone calls from pharmacy staff to physician practices related to drug coverage are reduced. Prescribers access prescription benefit information through software from a vendor that is certified for these services</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Medication History</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts delivers medication history information across providers during a patient's office visit through electronic prescribing and electronic health record systems that are certified for the Medication History service. The service is made possible by Surescripts’ ability to securely access and aggregate patient medication history data from community pharmacies and patient medication claims history from payers and pharmacy benefit managers. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Prescribers who can access critically important information on their patient's current and past prescriptions are better informed about potential medication issues with their patients and can use this information to improve safety and quality. Medication History can also be used for reconciliation support for patients being treated in an inpatient setting.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Prescription Routing Services</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">By eliminating paper, phone and fax, electronic Prescription Routing makes getting patients the medications they need a safer and more efficient process. Prescription Routing replaces old, error-prone approaches to sending new prescriptions – e.g. handwritten prescriptions, computer-printed prescriptions and hand or computer-faxed prescriptions – with the secure computer-to-computer exchange of prescriptions between prescribers and pharmacies. Routing new prescriptions electronically reduces the risk of medication errors associated with poor handwriting, illegible faxes and manual data entry. Using Prescription Routing to process prescription renewals saves health care professionals time and money by dramatically reducing the number of phone calls and faxes typically associated with the prescription renewal authorization process. MGMA studies have estimated that the value of the time spent just on prescription renewal authorization phone calls costs practices $10,000 a year per physician. With electronic prescription renewals, prescribers can receive electronic authorization requests directly and securely to practice computers as an alternative to time consuming phone calls and faxes. Physicians or authorized staff can then return approvals or denials with a few mouse clicks at their convenience, in seconds, which could translate into more time with patients for physicians and more efficient use of staff</p>
