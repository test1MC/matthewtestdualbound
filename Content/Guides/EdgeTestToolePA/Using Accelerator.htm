        <p>Upon launching the Accelerator to the Worklist, users are presented with all of the tasks that may require user interaction (from a provider perspective). In order for tasks to show up on the Accelerator Worklist, PBM/payers must respond to the PA messages from within the PBM/payer’s ePA system. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Users can select individual tasks to review message formatting, answer questions and test question set logic as well as review how the PBM/payer’s system interacts with specific elements within the PA message set. For detailed information on how to use CompletEPA® Accelerator and process through the various task types, please refer to the CompletEPA® Accelerator User Guide.</p>
