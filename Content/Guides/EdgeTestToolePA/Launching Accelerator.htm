        <h1 class="Heading1" style="font-weight: bold;">Launching Accelerator</h1>
        <p>Once PAInitiationRequests have been sent to the PBM/payer’s ePA system via the Edge Test Tool, users can launch the Surescripts CompletEPA® Accelerator in order to view and process test ePAs from a provider perspective. Select the <b>Launch</b> option from under the Accelerator heading on the left side menu. </p>
        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Edge Test Tool ePA/Launching Accelerator.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 209px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Users are presented with several option prior to actually launching the Accelerator. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch To:</span> Allows user to launch directly to the Worklist or Process List. The Worklist is the list that shows all tasks sitting at the provider’s responsibility. The Process List shows all active and completed tasks for the provider, regardless of whether they are sitting at PBM/payer or provider responsibility. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">End User Id:</span> Enter a user id for purposes of identifying the user who is working on tasks. This id does not need to be defined in advance and only shows up in tasks’ audit history. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">This value is required to launch CompletEPA®  Accelerator.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Provider Id: </span>This is the test SPI for the logged in user. In order for ePAs to show up on a prescriber’s Worklist or Process List, the PAInitiationRequests must be defined as coming from this SPI in the <b>From</b> field within the Message Header. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Edge Test Tool ePA/Launching Accelerator_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 90px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Users only need to launch the Accelerator for purposes of responding to PBM/payer responses to ePA message types. PAInitiationResponse and PAResponse messages should be generated directly from the PBM/payer’s system as if the ePA came from a standard provider vendor.</p>
