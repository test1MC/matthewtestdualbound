        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc450902824"></a>Workflow Overview</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts provides multiple workflows to enable pharmacies to automate the retrospective prior authorization process.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The preferred workflow is when both the pharmacy and the provider system have implemented the NCPDP 10.6 RxChange message with the prior authorization use case.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">An alternate workflow is for the pharmacy to send an RxChangeRequest for prior authorization addressed to a generic Surescripts SPI and Surescripts notifies the prescriber via fax of the need for prior authorization. Surescripts uses the structured data from the RxChangeRequest message to allow the provider to complete the prior authorization process electronically using CompletEPA® QuickStart™. The pharmacy can also choose to send the notification fax instead of having Surescripts fax on its behalf. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The alternate workflow gives the pharmacy many of the benefits of the complete RxChange workflow for prescribers who have not yet implemented RxChange:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved PA turnaround time using CompletEPA<sup>®</sup>.</li>
            <li>Provides PA determination to pharmacies using RxChangeResponse to close the loop.</li>
        </ul>
