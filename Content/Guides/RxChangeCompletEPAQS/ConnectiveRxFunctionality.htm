        <p>Surescripts can provide prior authorization coverage for nearly 100 percent of patients on the Surescripts network. This coverage comes from Surescripts’ direct electronic connections to PBM/payers using CompletEPA® and is supplemented through a partnership with ConnectiveRx using its extensive PA forms library.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When Surescripts cannot find an electronic route for prior authorization, either through the PBM/payer or through a third party PA processor or health plan, Surescripts will use the BIN/PCN information from the RxChangeRequest to invoke ConnectiveRx and to provide the correct prior authorization form within the CompletEPA® QuickStart™. Surescripts does not have visibility into the status of any prior authorizations done through ConnectiveRx and will be unable to send an RxChangeResponse to the pharmacy.</p>
