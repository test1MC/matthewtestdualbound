        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc450902825"></a>Workflows</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">The following section outlines the steps a pharmacy should take depending on whether the physician is enabled for RxChange and if the pharmacy or Surescripts does the faxing. Surescripts supports two workflows depending on whether the pharmacy is checking for the provider’s ability to accept RxChange or allowing Surescripts to perform that check on the pharmacy’s behalf.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc450902826"></a>Surescripts Determines Route – RxChange Request to Generic SPI</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">In this workflow the pharmacy sends the RxChangeRequest to a generic SPI and Surescripts determines RxChange or fax route.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The following steps depict the RxChange message flow when Surescripts determines whether the provider has an RxChange service level and faxes the prior authorization notification on behalf of the pharmacy. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Surescripts uses a generic faxing template at this time and there is no pharmacy-specific branding. The fax template provides instructions for using CompletEPA® QuickStart™ and it also outlines the other options available to providers for responding to the PA notifications.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pharmacy processes the prescription and identifies the need for prior authorization.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy sends Surescripts an RxChangeRequest to SPI “0000000000000” (a generic SPI).</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Surescripts requires the pharmacy to send the provider’s fax number. Pharmacies should review fax number accuracy on a regular basis and have a secondary process in place if the fax process fails.</p>
