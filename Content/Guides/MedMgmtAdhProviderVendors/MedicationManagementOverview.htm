        <p class="BodyText1">Medication Management for Adherence provides managed and interactive medication management information to providers during and in-between patient visits, in partnership with PBM/payer and provider vendor partners. The product will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a core set of messages, visible to providers that provide specific and actionable medication information for a patient.</li>
            <li>For every message, Surescripts will receive specific data elements from PBM/payers. Content will be standardized across message type.</li>
            <li>Enable providers to view Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) information at all times. </li>
            <li>Intelligently manage the information and messages to prevent ‘alert fatigue’.</li>
            <li>Create feedback for the PBM/payers in an automated and elective fashion.</li>
        </ul>
