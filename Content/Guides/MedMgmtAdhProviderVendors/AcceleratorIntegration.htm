        <p class="BodyText1">The accelerator delivers a method for provider vendors to quickly offer customers core Medication Management for Adherence features. By embedding an iframe (or using a web browser control) in the provider vendor system, the accelerator will manage the process of viewing and responding to medication management messages.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The accelerator is comprised of two APIs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Application API - provides a customizable user interface</li>
            <li>Web Service API - gives programmatic read-only access to the current state of workflow processes and tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">The Web Application API provides a customizable interface that is displayed in an iframe (or a web browser control) in the provider vendor system. The interface interacts with the accelerator and its managed workflow. In order to use the Web Application API, the provider vendor system must first call the Web Service API to request and receive an authorization token.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When a PBM/payer sends Surescripts a medication management message, the accelerator workflow engine creates a workflow process. The workflow engine tracks all subsequent actions on the medication management message and distributes workflow tasks related to the process.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">End users are able to interact with a worklist, which is the collection of active tasks that require action from the current user. The end user may complete the task via the user interface provided by the Web Application API.</p>
