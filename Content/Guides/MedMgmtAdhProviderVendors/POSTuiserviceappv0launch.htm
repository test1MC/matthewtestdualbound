        <p class="BodyText1">The worklist contains the user’s actionable tasks. The user may select a task and trigger the accelerator to go to the appropriate view for that task. Tasks related to Medication Management for Adherence are optionally assigned to the recipient sent by the PBM/payer in the medication management message, e.g. the NPI of the provider sent in the PBM/payer medication management message.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The user viewing and working on a task must have the permissions for the task as described in <MadCap:xref href="../Accelerator/WebAppUserSecurity.htm#Authentication_Authorization">Authentication and Authorization on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Launch by provider or by patient is controlled by the “provider” or “patient” section being included in the auth token request. These roles are then encoded in the Auth Token and used when querying for tasks.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Product is a field in the auth token request as well. It is an array of objects that have an id and an array of processTypes. If nothing is sent for “products”, the user will see all products implemented for that launch context.</p>
