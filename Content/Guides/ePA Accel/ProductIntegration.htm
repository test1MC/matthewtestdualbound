        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">The Accelerator delivers a method for provider vendors to quickly offer customers core ePA features by embedding an iframe (or using a web browser control) in the provider vendor system that will manage the process of completing an ePA.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">The Accelerator is comprised of two APIs: the Web Application API, which provides a customizable user interface, and a Web Service API, which gives programmatic read-only access to the current state of workflow processes and tasks.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">The Web Application API provides a customizable interface that is displayed in an iframe (or a web browser control) in the provider vendor system. The interface interacts with the Accelerator and its managed workflow. In order to use the Web Application API, the provider vendor system must first call the Web Service API to request and receive an authorization token.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:changes="1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Authorization tokens are issued for 60 minutes and contain the expiration date and time. A new authorization token is not required to relaunch the Accelerator if still active or before the expiration period has elapsed.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">When an end user sends a PAInitiationRequest via the native CompletEPA<sup MadCap:changes="1">®</sup> route, the Accelerator workflow engine creates a workflow process. The workflow process is given an InitiatorsProcessID, which is the PAReferenceID from the PAInitiationRequest. The workflow engine tracks all subsequent messages related to the PAInitiationRequest and distributes workflow tasks related to the process.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">End users are able to interact with a worklist, which is the collection of active tasks that require action from the current user. The Web Service API gives programmatic read-only access to the current state of workflow processes and tasks.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">When an Accelerator process reaches a point where the end user needs to take action on a task, e.g.; complete a question set, the end user can complete the task via the user interface provided by the Web Application API. Additionally, the Accelerator provides a historic view of in-process and completed ePA activities.</p>
