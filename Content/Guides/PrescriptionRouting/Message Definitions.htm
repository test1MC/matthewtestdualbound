        <p>In SCRIPT 10.8 the mandatory drug loop was changed from “prescribed” to “dispensed”. Since we are moving toward a mandatory segment, we need to require both in the transition period. The reason for sending the prescribed is to assist the prescriber in matching the medication to what was sent on the original NewRx.</p>
        <p>On the RefillRequest the pharmacy should use both the prescribed and dispensed medication loops to indicate the number of refills requested.</p>
        <p>Surescripts requires that the medication prescribed and medication dispensed loops be included on the RefillRequest. The medication prescribed loop from the pharmacy should not contain the literal prescribed medication information that was provided by the prescriber on a NewRx, but instead should include the pharmacist’s interpretation of the medication ordered by the prescriber. The medication dispensed is the medication that the pharmacy dispensed to the patient. The pharmacy is requesting that the medication listed in the dispensed loop be renewed. The prescriber system should indicate that the dispensed medication is the item being requested for renewal. The medication prescribed information is displayed to the prescriber for cross-reference only.</p>
        <p>As stated in the RES segment definition, only certain fields can be changed on a RefillResponse for an Approve. Refer to RES-010, for details.</p>
        <p>If the RefillResponse is for a controlled substance, the prescriber is required to sign the medication prescribed information. Even though the medication prescribed is sent for cross-reference on the RefillRequest, it becomes what the prescriber is approving on the RefillResponse. Therefore, the prescriber is actually approving both what was prescribed and dispensed. The pharmacy can still substitute and dispense what was dispensed before.</p>

        <p class="BodyText1">NewRx sent by prescriber with substitutions allowed.</p>

The DNTF Refill Renewal Response should contain the original prescriber's name, and the NewRx should be from the new prescriber.</p></li>
            <li>If the prescriber order number cannot be used to match a NewRx to a Refill Renewal Request; the following data in the prescribed drug, prescriber, and pharmacy segments in the Refill Renewal Request should be used to link the Refill Renewal Request to the original NewRx:<ul><li><p>RelatesToMessageID</p></li><li><p>Patient matching: name, date of birth, gender</p></li><li><p>Prescribed Drug – one or more of these data elements in the prescribed drug segment: Drug name, dose form, strength, NDC, FMT coded quantity</p></li><li><p>Prescriber – One or more of these elements: SPI, NPI, name, communication number</p></li><li><p>Pharmacy – One or more of these elements: NCPDP ID, NPI, Pharmacy Name, Communication Number</p></li></ul></li>
            <li>Many of our vendors have found it helpful to couple the Refill Renewal Request/Refill Renewal Response/Denied New Prescription To Follow processes together, so they do not send the Refill Renewal Response until the NewRx has been completed. This helps keep the messages tied together and prevents issues with the pharmacy receiving the Refill Renewal Response, but not the NewRx.</li>
            <li>When a prescriber leaves a practice the prescriber should be disabled in the directory from that practice as soon as they leave to prevent renewals from being sent and approved for a prescriber no longer practicing at that location.</li>

        <p class="BodyText1">The <span style="font-style: italic;">RxFill</span> message is originated by the pharmacy. This message notifies the prescriber about the status of a prescription - either new, renewal or resupply. <span style="font-style: italic;">RxFill</span> messages should be viewed by the prescriber as individual snapshots in time regarding a prescription; not a final or complete status. The <span style="font-style: italic;">RxFill</span> message can be used in three instances:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The implementation of RxFill messaging will be a transition over a significant period of time due to the requirements for coding and rollout of pharmacy and prescriber systems to utilize RxFill.</li>
            <li>Since RxFill is not a mandatory transaction, utilization will likely not achieve 100% participation.</li>
            <li>Participation in RxFill usage is voluntary for both pharmacies and prescribers.</li>
            <li>RxFill messages may be sent for prescriptions received by the pharmacy in any form (paper, fax, phone, or electronic) when the prescriber associated with the prescription is accessible via the electronic network.</li>
            <li>Since all pharmacies and prescriber practices may not have all the technology required to send all types of RxFill messages, some percentage of providers will not participate in RxFill message tracking.</li>
            <li>Because of the variation in participation, capability, and timing by pharmacies in the utilization of RxFill messages, the prescriber should be careful in the analysis and assumptions based on their usage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4" MadCap:autonum="1.4.1.1 ">RxFill for LTC Assumptions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation of RxFill is standard in LTC pharmacy/organization communication and is used to inform the LTC organization of medication review and pharmacy approval for dispensing. In addition, this message indicates that a medication order has/has not been dispensed by the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Where RxFill is not a mandatory transaction, utilization in LTC is likely to still be 100% participation as most trading partner agreements consider this transaction mandatory.</li>
            <li>Because of the variation in the use cases of RxFill in LTC, careful consideration should be taken to consume the information provided as sent by the pharmacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="1.4.2 ">RxFill Message Flow</h3>
        <p>The following steps depict the RxFill message flow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A prescription at the pharmacy is dispensed to a patient or, for LTC, is delivered.</li>
            <li>The pharmacy submits an <span style="font-style: italic;">RxFill</span> message via Surescripts to the original prescriber.</li>
            <li>Surescripts validates the message. If there is an issue with the message, Surescripts sends an Error message back to the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Surescripts successfully transmits the <span style="font-style: italic;">RxFill</span> message to the prescriber.</li>
            <li>The prescriber's system validates the request and returns a <span style="font-style: italic;">Status</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Error</span> (if errors are found) or <span style="font-style: italic;">Verify</span> message.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If a <span style="font-style: italic;">Status 000</span> is sent in step 5, the prescriber's system would send a Verify.</li></ol></li>

        <ul>
            <li>For prescriptions received by the pharmacy in non-electronic form, the subsequent RxFill messages will not be able to reference an original electronic Message ID or other unique electronic identifier for the prescription. The pharmacy should populate the RxFill message with adequate patient and drug information and the prescriber should be able to match these messages to the appropriate patient and prescription.</li>
            <li>Prescriber should anticipate and successfully process RxFill messages where the status (dispensed, partially dispensed, not dispensed, or transferred) changes over time. For example, the physician may receive an RxFill (not dispensed) message for a specific prescription today and then receive an RxFill (dispensed) message for the same prescription the next day in the case where a patient forgot to pick up their medication in time but came to the pharmacy again the next day. <b>The RxFill messages should be viewed as a snapshot in time, not a permanent status indicator.</b></li>
            <li>Prescriber should anticipate that RxFill messages will only be received for a portion of the prescriptions the physician writes. <b>If no RxFill message is received for a prescription, the system cannot assume that the prescription has not been dispensed or that the patient is not compliant.</b><ul><li>Prescriber should anticipate receiving an RxFill notification only for prescriptions from pharmacies that support the RxFill transaction.</li><li>Prescriber should anticipate there may be significant time delays between writing the prescription and the receipt of an RxFill indicating the current status.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4" MadCap:autonum="1.4.4.2 ">RxFill Dispensed</h4>
        <p>The RxFill message is originated by the pharmacy. This message is used to notify the prescriber when a prescription has been dispensed. This message can be used to notify dispensed status of new prescriptions, refills or medication resupply requests.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RxFill (dispensed) message would be sent for all dispensed prescriptions including each refill/resupply, but excluding partial fills, which are represented by a separate message.</li>
            <li>RxFill (dispensed) message should be triggered by a specific action in the pharmacy that indicates that the prescription was dispensed and not simply filled and waiting. Therefore, the RxFill (dispensed) message should not be triggered simply by label printing or adjudication in the pharmacy, but through an action such as a Point of Sale message, Electronic Signature Capture at pickup, a <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-09-29T13:51:37.0977084-05:00" MadCap:creator="Sally.Fresquez" MadCap:initials="SA" MadCap:comment="See JIRA item for changes to BIN – now using IIN."

For LTC, RxFill (dispensed) should be triggered by a specific action in the pharmacy that indicates that the prescription was dispensed and/or filled and approved for administration to the patient by the LTC organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4" MadCap:autonum="1.4.4.3 ">RxFill Not dispensed</h4>
        <p>The RxFill message (not dispensed) is originated by the pharmacy. This message is used when the pharmacy has not dispensed a previously filled prescription and the pharmacy will return the medication to stock. This might occur if the patient never picked up the prescription. This message is used in LTC when the pharmacy will not dispense a prescription to notify the LTC organization of the status and reason the prescription will not be dispensed. This message can be used to notify dispensing status of new prescriptions, refills or resupply requests.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RxFill (not dispensed) message would be sent when a pharmacy does not successfully dispense or does not intend to dispense a prescription that has been received and processed by the pharmacy, and/or has been waiting for patient pickup.</li>
            <li>RxFill (not dispensed) message should be triggered by the Return to Stock process of the pharmacy, which indicates the patient has not picked up the prescription within the time period set by the pharmacy for their Return To Stock procedures.</li>
            <li>RxFill (not dispensed) message should be sent for any prescription (first fill, refill/resupply, partial fill, etc.) that is processed by the pharmacy during Return to Stock procedures.</li>
            <li>RxFill (not dispensed) message should not be sent by the pharmacy in the case where a prescription is being reversed, but with the intent of subsequent reprocessing and dispensing. An example would be a change in payment coverage requested by the patient at the time of pickup.</li>
            <li>	RxFill (not dispensed) message should not be sent by the pharmacy to indicate that the patient has not requested his/her next refill based on elapsed time since the patient’s previous refill. For example, if the pharmacy dispensed a 30-day supply to the patient but more than 30 days have elapsed and the patient has not requested another refill, the pharmacy system should not automatically generate an RxFill (not dispensed) message. The pharmacy system should use the specific actions of the patient when sending RxFill messages and not inferences in every case possible.</li>
            <li>RxFill (not dispensed) message in LTC should be triggered by events as determined by the pharmacy at the time of processing. Examples include Drug Use Evaluation conflicts that could not be resolved, the medication order has expired, the pharmacy has no intent to stock the prescribed medication, or a prior authorization was required for the prescribed medication and the payer has denied.</li>
            <li>Since Return to Stock procedures and timing differ between pharmacies, the timing of the RxFill (not dispensed) message will also vary.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4" MadCap:autonum="1.4.4.4 ">RxFill Partially Dispensed</h4>
        <p>The RxFill (Partially Dispensed) message is originated by the pharmacy. This message is used to notify the prescriber or LTC organization when a prescription has only been partially dispensed. This message can be used to notify dispensing status of new prescriptions, refills, or medication resupply requests. An RxFill message (partially dispensed) can be repeatedly initiated until the prescription has been completely dispensed or the remaining quantity is returned to stock, thereby requiring an RxFill (not dispensed) message for the remaining quantity. The message requires that, at a minimum, the dispensed drug with the quantity received be included in the message. It is suggested that the prescribed drug be included for clarification.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RxFill (partially dispensed) message would be sent for all dispensed prescriptions where only a portion of the specified quantity is provided. Subsequent dispensing of the remainder of the partial fill, or additional partial fills, would also require an appropriate RxFill (partially dispensed) message to be sent.</li>
            <li>RxFill (partially dispensed) message should be triggered by a specific action in the pharmacy that indicates that the prescription was dispensed and not simply filled and waiting. Therefore, the RxFill (partially dispensed) message should not be triggered simply by label printing or adjudication in the pharmacy, but through an action such as a Point of Sale message, Electronic Signature Capture at pickup, a <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-09-29T13:58:58.2016208-05:00" MadCap:creator="Sally.Fresquez" MadCap:initials="SA" MadCap:comment="Also verify JIRA for change from BIN to IIN."

        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.5 ">Census </h2>
        <p>In LTC, three changes to the patient status occur regularly that drive processes at the pharmacy but are not necessarily tied to a prescription. Because of this, a message type is necessary to convey patient information “decoupled” from any prescription information. The three key use cases that are relevant in LTC are New Admission, Information Change, and Discharge.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The <span style="font-style: italic;">Census</span> message is originated by the facility in an LTC environment. This message notifies the pharmacy about census events and can be used in three cases - to notify the pharmacy of a new resident, a change to demographic information of a resident, or the discharge of a resident.</p>
        <p>The differentiation of the three cases is with the use of the 010 Message Function Coded in the REQ <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-09-25T15:19:41.8736652-05:00" MadCap:creator="Sally.Fresquez" MadCap:initials="SA" MadCap:comment="Replace REQ 010 with coorect element."

            <li>A resident record is added or updated within a facility system.</li>
            <li>Facility system submits a Census message via Surescripts to the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Surescripts validates the message. If there is an issue with the message, Surescripts sends an Error message back to the requester.</li>
            <li>Surescripts successfully transmits the Census message to the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy system validates the message and returns a Status, Error (if errors are found), or Verify message.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If a Status 000 is sent in step 5, the pharmacy system would send a Verify.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Surescripts transmits the Status or Error message back to the facility system.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.6 ">Resupply</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">In the LTC environment there is a need to send a <span style="font-style: italic;">Resupply</span> message from a facility to a pharmacy. An example use case is when a medication supply for a resident is running low (2-3 doses) and a new supply is needed from the pharmacy, the nurse needs a way to notify the pharmacy that more medication is needed. Since medication has already been authorized on the original order, the Resupply is simply a request for more inventory, therefore this is not a fillable message like the Refill Renewal Response.</p>

            <li>Prescriber systems should maintain a record within their system, i.e. patient prescription profile to document that a Cancel Rx Request was initiated along with the acknowledgment and the action taken by the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy should update the patient medication profile within their systems to document along with the appropriate response.</li>

        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 2:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

            <li>Pharmacy should send an "A" (Approval) code in the Cancel Rx Response message with a Note that specifies how many refills have been dispensed already. This would clearly indicate the number of prescription refills that were dispensed and that there are no remaining refills left. Pharmacy should mark the prescription cancelled so that a refill request will not be sent at a later date.</li>

            <li>In this scenario, pharmacies should send a "D" (Denied) code back in the Cancel Rx Response message to the prescriber. Sending this code back would clearly indicate to the prescriber that the pharmacy hasn't cancelled the prescription.

        <p>The following steps depict the Cancel Rx message flow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prescriber initiates a Cancel Rx Request for a patient via a prescriber system.</li>
            <li>Prescriber system successfully transmits the Cancel Rx Request to Surescripts.</li>
            <li>Surescripts validates the message. If there is an issue with the message, Surescripts sends an Error message back to the requester.</li>
            <li>Surescripts utilizes the Recipient ID and routes the message appropriately.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy system validates the Cancel Rx Request and responds with a Status, Error (if errors are found), or Verify message.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If a Status 000 was sent in step 5, the pharmacy system would send a Verify.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Surescripts transmits the Status, Error, or Verify back to the sender.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy processes the Cancel Rx Request and returns the prescribers' Cancel Prescription Response.</li>
            <li>Surescripts validates the message. If there is an issue with the message, Surescripts sends an Error message back to the pharmacy system.</li>
            <li>Surescripts transmits the Cancel Rx Response message back to the prescriber system.</li>
            <li>Prescriber system validates the Cancel Rx Request Response and returns a Status, Error (if errors are found), or Verify message.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If a Status 000 is sent in step 10, the prescriber system would send a Verify.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Surescripts transmits the Status, Error, or Verify back to the pharmacy system.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Cancel Rx Request can be sent for paper or electronic.</li>
            <li>Cancel Rx Request should not be faxed.</li>
            <li>Cancel Rx Response time – If no response after 12 hours the prescriber should call the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy should always treat incoming Cancel Rx Request messages as top priority and as such display them prominently to their end users. If the Cancel Rx Request message has already been processed, further action may be required, but it doesn't need to be treated as top priority.</li>
            <li>Prescribers should not send a Cancel Rx Request for a prescription that is expired based on federal or state regulations. There should be programmatic checks in place to allow a Cancel Rx Request up to the expiration date of the prescription based off of the written date of the prescription. For example, the DEA requires Controlled Substance Rx to be filled within 6 months from the date written, and most states limit the filling of non-controlled Rx's to 1 year from the date written.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy should always include a Note in an "A" (Approval) Cancel Rx Response message when responding to a Cancel Rx Request message if the patient has picked up the "first fill" or any refills thereafter and the pharmacy is cancelling the remaining refills left on the prescription.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy should not send any Refill Renewal Request message after a Cancel Rx Request message is received.</li>
            <li> A prescriber who has assumed responsibility for the patient's care may potentially cancel any prescription, even if they are not the original prescriber. It remains up to the pharmacy to determine if the Cancel Rx Request from the prescriber is appropriate.</li>
            <li>The Cancel Rx Request should contain the RxNorm in the &lt;DrugCoded&gt;.</li>
            <li>The Cancel Rx Request should contain pertinent information for the pharmacy to be able to find the prescription in their system (patient, medication (name, strength, and dosage form), and prescriber). If the pharmacy cannot definitively determine the prescription to be canceled, manual processes will occur to verify the cancellation.</li>
            <li>Pharmacies should not delete a Cancel Rx Request message from a processing queue without a response being generated to the requestor. Pharmacy edits should be put in place to not allow a medication to be provided to the patient if a Cancel Rx Response has not been sent.</li>
            <li>The prescriber should notify the patient or caregiver to inform them of the cancellation of a prescription. The Cancel Rx Request was not intended to relieve the prescriber of the responsibility of notifying the patient or caregiver to advise of the drug therapy change – it is only intended as a backup to prevent inadvertent drug therapy continuation or resumption at a later date.</li>
            <li>Pharmacy should provide clear denial reasons in Cancel Rx Response denial responses. Note the Description of &lt;DenialReasonCode&gt; is the description of the value defined in the NCPDP External Code List.
