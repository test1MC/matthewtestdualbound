        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts change management aims to ensure that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient handling of all changes. A change is an event that results in a new status of one or more products or services, which is approved by management and enhances product or service changes (fixes) with minimized risk to IT infrastructure or existing processing to the extent possible.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The primary aim of Surescripts change management includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimal disruption of production services;</li>
            <li>Reduction in back-out activities;</li>
            <li>Transition of new or improved services into production for customers</li>
            <li>Management of resources involved in the change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">The Surescripts Change Advisory Board meets regularly to formally review, approve and schedule changes. Changes that may result in service interruptions or functionality changes visible to customers are communicated externally in advance as described in <a href="ServiceAvailability.htm">Service Availability</a>.</p>

        <p class="BodyText1">Customer will provide a minimum of four (4) months calendar notification prior to any software change that will require the customer to re-certify the corresponding code changes against Surescripts certification standards for the affected product or service.
