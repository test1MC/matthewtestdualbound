        <p class="BodyText1">This Network Operations Guide (“NOG”) Customer Reference Guide for Surescripts Network Operations and Service Level Agreements (SLA), hereafter referred to as "NOG", is provided by Surescripts to outline responsibilities, expectations, and operating principles regarding customers' interconnection to generally available services on the Surescripts<sup>®</sup> production network.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The objective of the NOG is to define availability and quality of service associated with the operations of the Surescripts production network for Surescripts and connected network customers. Although this document will establish the initial framework for network operations, it will change over time as required and Surescripts shall provide email or bulletin notice to customers of any changes. The NOG is complementary to any service level commitments established within the appropriate agreements currently in place between the parties. In the event of any conflict between this NOG and any agreement between the parties, the agreement shall govern.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">This document should be shared with customer business management, technology operations and support staff responsible for the deployment, development and day-to-day operations of Surescripts offered services specifically stated in this document. The information in this document is limited to Surescripts products and services in production and does not include products or services in development, pilot, or early adopter status.</p>

        <p class="BodyText1">Prior to the customer’s access to the Surescripts production environment, the customer will receive a copy of the NOG. The customer will be deemed to have received the NOG once Surescripts has sent the NOG to any of the notice addresses (e-mail, facsimile, or physical address) provided in the customer’s contractual agreement(s) with Surescripts.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">All  Surescripts customers must review the content of this NOG with all relevant staff, including Management, Production Support, Technology and Operations teams as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than the customer entering into production on the Surescripts network. The customer will provide and review the NOG on an ongoing basis with any new staff providing services relevant to the subject matter herein. The customer will provide a copy of the NOG to their Technical Support team.</p>
