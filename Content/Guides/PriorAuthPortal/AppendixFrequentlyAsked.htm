        <p class="BodyText1">Q: How do I submit the Authorization Number from an Approved Prior Authorization (PA) to the pharmacy for the approved medication?</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">A: The Authorization Number, if provided, is on the Acknowledge Approved PA task on the Worklist. If the task has already been acknowledged, it is accessible from the Task History. You are able to use the filters to find the specific ePA process easier. If there is no prior authorization number shown, that means that the PBM/payer does not require it when submitting the NewRx.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Q: Who do I contact if I don’t agree with a decision that has been made on a prior authorization?</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">A: The PBM/payer should send contact information in all ePA responses that indicates how to get in touch with someone who can further speak to the status of a prior authorization determination. </p>
