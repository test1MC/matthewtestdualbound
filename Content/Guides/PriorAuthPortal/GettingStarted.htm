        <p class="BodyText1">A web browser with JavaScript and session cookies enabled is required.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts expects, but does not guarantee, performance on any up-to-date web browser or client/server web browser control. There may be compatibility issues if an older version of a browser is used. If compatibility issues occur, another browser or a later version should be used.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Please be aware that individual browser security settings may prevent the application from properly launching. The website surescripts.net may also need to be added as a “trusted site” for proper functioning.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Registra"></a>Registration</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">Users must register before using the Prior Authorization Portal. Prescriber accounts are available for users with a registered NPI that will manage the prior authorization for a prescription they have written. Delegate accounts are available for users that are managing a prior authorization on behalf of the prescribing provider.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Once registration is complete, users may log in using the associated email address and password. If the user was provided a TRX Code, the code can be entered on the homepage during the sign in process.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">NPI is required when registering as a “Prescriber”. The name on the account must match the name under which the NPI is registered. Once the account has been created, the user's name on the account cannot be changed.</p>
