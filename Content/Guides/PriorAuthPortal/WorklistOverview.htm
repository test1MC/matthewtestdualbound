        <h1 class="Heading1">Worklist Overview</h1>
        <p class="BodyText1">The tasks listed on the Worklist are specific to prescriber location where the user is signed in. This assignment is listed in the top right under the “Working at” designation. The location and prescriber can be changed by clicking on the drop-down arrow adjacent to the listed assignment. The Worklist provides a centralized view of all tasks that may require action from the user accessing it. Worklist tasks reflect access assigned to each user – a user is associated with tasks for specific providers/patients as well as assigned a role for each of those affiliations.</p>
