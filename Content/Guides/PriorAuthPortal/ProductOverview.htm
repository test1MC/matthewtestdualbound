        <h2 class="Heading2" style="page-break-before: avoid;"><a name="About"></a>About the Prior Authorization Portal</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">Prior Authorization Portal (formerly QuickStart™) enables providers to submit fully electronic prior authorization requests right away, even if electronic prior authorization is not yet available through the provider vendor system. Prior Authorization Portal is a free, easy to use, web-based solution with no application to install and can be accessed at <a href="http://www.surescripts.com/priorauthportal" target="_blank">www.surescripts.com/priorauthportal</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Using"></a>Using the Prior Authorization Portal</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Prior Authorization Portal allows users to initiate prior authorizations using two methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initiate a prior authorization using a TRX Code provided by the pharmacy through a fax notifying the provider that a prior authorization is needed.</li>
            <li>Initiate a prior authorization at the time of prescribing by entering patient, plan, medication and pharmacy details within the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="What"></a>What is a TRX Code?</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">The TRX Code is delivered via fax by the pharmacy to initiate prior authorization after a prescription drug has been rejected at the pharmacy. The code is linked to a specific patient, drug, and benefit information.</p>
        <div class="note">

            <ul>
                <li>The TRX Code is a 16 character (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX), case sensitive code. </li>
                <li>Each code will contain a combination of randomly selected uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. TRX Codes will not include the following characters: 0's, O's, o's, l, 1, I, i, m, n, 8, B, 2, Z. </li>
                <li>TRX codes expires after 7 days.</li>
