        <h1 class="Heading1">Workflow Task History Overview</h1>
        <p class="BodyText1">The workflow Task History allows users to track the status and details of any action that has been completed on a prior authorization process. Users can select task history to see if Question Sets have been completed, responses have been acknowledged or if a prior authorization is awaiting a response from the PBM/payer. By default, the application displays 30 days of ePA cases, but the available filtering options allow users to define a custom date range (as well as other filters).</p>
