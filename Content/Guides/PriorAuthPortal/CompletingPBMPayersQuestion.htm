        <ol start="1">
            <li><b>Question Number</b> – This represents the current question number being displayed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Question set numbers may not be sequential and do not indicate progress towards completion.</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li><b>Progress Bar</b> – Shows the user their progress through the current Question Set.</li>
            <li><b>Question</b> – This shows the user the current question that the user is answering. Question types are based on the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, (NCPDP) standard; see the <a href="#888898323">Question Types</a> section for more details on the different question types.</li>
            <li><b>Navigation Buttons</b> – These allow the user to go back or forward one question. </li>
            <li><b>Options Drop-Down</b> – The Options drop-down menu allows the users to navigate through the portal as needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText1">After opening a task, the user can click the <b>Start</b> button to be presented with the PBM/payer’s first question. Question Sets are intended to have built-in logic that prevents users from being presented with irrelevant questions. Please note that content and complexity of the Question Set logic will vary from PBM/payer to PBM/payer. The progress bar indicates current progress towards completing the Question Set. </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">User sessions time out after a period of one hour, regardless of progress or action being taken within a task.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Navigating to the next question will automatically save progress on previously answered questions. Progress will not be automatically saved by clicking on <b>Task History</b> or <b>Return to Worklist</b>. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Different options are presented for answering a question based on the question type, see the <a href="#888898323">Question Types</a> section for more details on the different question types. The application performs data type validation on responses before allowing them to be saved or submitted to the PBM/payer. This means that a single select question will not allow users to submit multiple selections and a number type question will be limited to numerical values – the application does not check for validity of response, but merely follows the question logic provided by the PBM/payer within the Question Set.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Saving"></a>Saving Progress</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1"> Question Set progress is saved based on the user's last answered question. This does not submit the Question Set to the PBM/payer but allows the user to return to finish at a later point or allows another user to finish responding. </p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Due to branching Question Set logic, if a user changes a previously provided response, they may be required to answer additional questions.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Once responses have been verified, click the <b>Submit</b> button to send the completed Question Set to the PBM/payer.</p>
