        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:changes="1" MadCap:autonum="1.1.1 ">Implementation Process</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">You will be invited to a Surescripts education session, receive Surescripts network guides and requirement documentation. Your account will be set up to access the Surescripts staging/certification environment. The timeframe of the Implementation Phase can vary depending on your resource allocation for the project. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:changes="1" MadCap:autonum="1.1.2 ">Certification Process</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">This phase includes more detailed testing of the transactions and the user interface to ensure that all Surescripts requirements are met. You will be assigned a Certification Project Manager who will work with you through the completion of certification testing. Surescripts will provide more detail surrounding the milestones that are necessary to certify and move into production. Once a participant passes certification, services are turned on in production.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:changes="1" MadCap:autonum="1.1.3 ">Transition to Production</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">Once Certification is complete, the participant is ready to move into production. Surescripts will schedule a hand-off meeting for the business and technical staff of both Surescripts and the participant to discuss the following:</p>
        <ul MadCap:changes="1">
            <li MadCap:changes="1">Production Support Contacts (Surescripts’ and participant’s)</li>
            <li MadCap:changes="1">Support Process</li>
            <li MadCap:changes="1">Support Hours</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:changes="1" MadCap:autonum="1.1.4 ">Certification Requirements</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">The Surescripts certification process ensures that participant software is able to send and receive electronic messages in accordance with industry standards and that it provides open choice for medication selection and dispensing location. In addition, Surescripts certification focuses on patient safety, efficiency of the electronic prescribing process and ease of use by end-users. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">Surescripts certification testing focuses on message format and application workflow, including display, per the Surescripts Implementation Guides and application requirements within those guides. By holding all participants equally accountable for meeting the certification application requirements, our participants can send and receive the highest quality electronic transactions as e-prescribing continues to progress overall as an industry.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">The application requirements that participants must meet in order to be certified on the Surescripts network are defined throughout this guide. These requirements are denoted with an asterisk following the word “shall*” and a unique identifier for tracking purposes. These requirements will be enforced as part of certification. Requirements that are enforced as part of the production code are simply denoted as “must”. All of these requirements shall be met in order to successfully complete certification. “Should” is used for guidance or what was previously called best practices. See the following chart for terminology usage.</p>
