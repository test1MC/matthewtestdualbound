        <h2 class="Heading2">Patient Identification</h2>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">A patient identifier is a requirement of the <i>IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework, </i>Volume 3, Revision 12.2 Final Text 22 April 2016 for XDR Requirements.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts inserts patient identifiers/demographics found in the message into the XDR message sent to the customer XDR interface using the following priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Patient demographics in the attached clinical document (CDA or CCR)</li>
            <li>XDR metadata found in the XDR envelope or the XDM metadata file</li>
            <li>Patient demographics in the header</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText1">If there are multiple clinical documents, the first document is used as the source of the patient identifier.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If there is no patient data available in the incoming message, Surescripts passes along the message without populating the patient data section of the XDR.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">By using the exact patient identifier or a demographics-based match, incoming messages can be associated with the correct patient or routed to the appropriate triage queue.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p class="insideNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Surescripts recommends the customer obtain an Object Identifier Definition (OID) from a registration authority. OIDs are a preferred scheme for unique identifiers in HL7 and should always be used except if one of the inclusion criteria for other schemes apply. </p>
            <p>Because patient IDs are passed as-is from multiple parties, Surescripts cannot guarantee that patient IDs are unique. Customers must ensure their workflows allow for verification of all patient matches based on third-party IDs, and allow users to correct patient mismatch cases when the same ID might have been used for multiple distinct patients.<br /></p>
        </div>
        <p class="BodyText1">XDR interfaces may have different levels of support for XDR message content. A typical Surescripts network message is an email-like message that contains a message body (free text) and a clinical document attachment (such as a CDA).</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" style="font-style: normal;">Furthermore, customers integrating with the XDR interface are encouraged to accept as wide a variety of content types (e.g. PDFs, CDAs) as possible. Each customer XDR interface can be configured with the acceptable content types. Surescripts informs senders of messages with unsupported content that their message was delivered successfully. This separate message is generated by Surescripts detailing which attachments were omitted from the delivered message.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Constraints on Standard XDR</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">The following constraints are placed on the ITI TF-2b section 3.41 definition of XDR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The transaction shall carry at least one document.</li>
            <li>	XDS Folder definitions are not supported.</li>
            <li>Only new document submissions, without reference to previous submissions, are supported (e.g. there is no support for replacing documents sent in previous transactions, or referencing documents from previous transactions).</li>
            <li>The <i>Basic Patient Privacy Enforcement Option </i>ITI TF-20 3.41.4.1.3.1 is not supported.</li>
            <li>The request/response must use the synchronous web services exchange model.</li>
            <li>Customers must follow all requirements in <i>XDR for Direct</i>.</li>
        </ul>
