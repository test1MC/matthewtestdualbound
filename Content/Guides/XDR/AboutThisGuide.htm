        <p class="BodyText1">This Surescripts XDR Implementation Guide was created to assist customers in developing and transferring messages needed to provide secure clinical information exchange between providers. The audience for this document includes any customer responsible for developing a system interface to the Surescripts network using XDR. This document assumes that the customer is already familiar with XDR and has a working XDR implementation. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1" style="font-style: normal;">XDR messaging is used to exchange <i>Clinical</i> messages. A Clinical Direct Message in the context of this guide is a message delivered to and from authorized customers on the Surescripts network and the Direct Trust that contains clinical or administrative information about a specific patient used for health care payment, treatment, or operations.</p>
