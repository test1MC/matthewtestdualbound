        <p class="BodyText1">The URI element of the Extrinsic Object associated with the attachment in the SOAP envelope is translated into the name of the attachment. If no URI element is provided, a generic (i.e. "DOC1.XXX" where "XXX" is the appropriate file extension) attachment name will be provided by Surescripts. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">For XDR messages converted to XDM archive attachments sent through the Direct Project, the attachment names are changed by Surescripts to conform to XDM archive requirements <i>Media File System and File Naming Restrictions </i>ITI TF-2b 3.32.4.1.2.1 requires that file names are limited to eight upper case characters (letters, digits, underscores, and a dot.extension) with a three-character extension. If the attachment name conforms to the above standard, except where lowercase characters are used, Surescripts will change lowercase to uppercase.</p>
