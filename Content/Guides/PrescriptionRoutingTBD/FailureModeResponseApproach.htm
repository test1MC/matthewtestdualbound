        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts has identified different levels of failure for NCPDP-based messages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In instances where Surescripts or a customer receives a message that is unrecognizable, the recipient should send back an error text.</li>
            <li>If an error occurs after the sender has been identified and validated, and the message has been determined to be an NCPDP message, an NCPDP Error message is returned.</li>
            <li>If the recipient identifies an error, an Error message is created and passed through Surescripts.</li>
        </ul>
