        <p class="BodyText1">The following general best practices apply to all prescription routing message types.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If customers implement any type of prescription message store and forward methodology, e.g. hub or central location, the storage/hold time period should be no more than 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>To maximize the use of electronic transmission, customers should default to electronically send within their application workflow when the receiver is electronically enabled.</li>
            <li>Application should not duplicate messages; i.e. electronically delivered as well as faxed.</li>
            <li>Applications should have the ability to send ICD-9 or ICD-10 information in all message types. This is because ICD-9/ICD-10 coding is required on some electronic claims. If the information is not included, it could result in a manual process between the provider and pharmacy.</li>
        </ol>
