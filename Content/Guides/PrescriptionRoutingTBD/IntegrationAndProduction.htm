        <p>Only qualified application vendors and pharmacies that have: completed Surescripts Certification, have a third-party Proof of Audit Letter, and have a Surescripts EPCS Audit Attestation Form, will be allowed to connect to the Surescripts network for EPCS.
</p>
        <p>The following steps are required to implement EPCS:
</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">1). Update e-prescribing software to meet all requirements specified by the DEA in the Interim Final Rule and the SCRIPT messaging version (this guide) that supports EPCS.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">
2). Undergo a third-party audit to ensure the software meets all DEA EPCS requirements.
</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">3). Achieve Surescripts Certification to the Surescripts Implementation Guide.
</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4). Make audit results available to Surescripts with a Proof of Audit Letter &amp; Surescripts EPCS Audit Attestation Form.

        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.2 "><a name="Prescrip"></a>Prescription Routing General Best Practices</h2>
        <p>The following general best practices apply to all prescription routing message types.</p>
        <p>1. The application should make clear to the user, which data elements will be sent to the receiver and whic elements are for interna/local <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-08-09T14:17:59.8916378-05:00" MadCap:creator="Sally.Fresquez" MadCap:initials="SA" MadCap:comment="Added by Work Group A 4.27.17." MadCap:editor="Sally.Fresquez" MadCap:editDate="2017-08-09T14:18:14.2820767-05:00">use.</MadCap:annotation></p>
        <p>2. If customers implement any type of prescription message store and forward methodology, e.g. hub or central location, the storage/hold time period should be no more than 1-2 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. to maximize the use of electronic transmission, customers should default to electronically send within their application workflow when the receiver is electronically enabled.</p>
        <p>4. Application should not duplicate messages; i.e. electronically delivered as well as faxed.</p>
        <p>5. Applications should have the ability to send ICD-9 or ICD-10 information in all message types. This is because ICD-9/ICD-10 coding is required on some electronic claims. If the information is not included, it could result in a manual process between the provider and pharmacy.</p>
        <p>6. Application should have the ability to send or receive EffectiveDate for future dating prescriptions.</p>
        <p>7. Notes and other free-text fields should not contain information for which there is a designated field. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.3 "><a name="Certific"></a>Certification Requirements</h2>
        <p>The Surescripts certification process ensures that customer software can send and receive electronic messages in accordance with industry standards and that it provides open choice for medication selection and dispensing location. In addition, Surescripts certification focuses on patient safety, efficiency of the electronic prescribing process and ease of use by end-users.</p>
        <p>Surescripts certification testing focuses on message format, application workflow, and display in accordance with Surescripts Implementation Guides and the associated Application Certification Requirements (ACR) document noted in Document References on page 16. By holding all customers accountable for meeting the ACRs, our customers can send and receive the highest quality messages as e-prescribing and clinical messaging continue to progress overall as an industry.</p>
