        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc443643325"></a>Rx Change</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">The <span style="font-style: italic;">Rx Change Request</span> message is originated by the pharmacy. This message is used to request a change to a new prescription. This request may be used when a pharmacy identifies a need to make a change to the original new prescription.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">An <span style="font-style: italic;">Rx Change Response</span> message is used to respond to an <span style="font-style: italic;">Rx Change Request </span>message. An example would be a request for a generic substitution.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The three codes available in the standard for <span style="font-style: italic;">Rx Change</span> are Therapeutic Interchange, Generic Substitution, and Prior Authorization. However, because we have more than three use cases, we have combined several into Therapeutic Interchange as shown below.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Use cases are described below along with how to populate the pertinent fields.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Use"></a>Use Cases – Therapeutic Interchange (Rx Change Request<br />Type = T)</h3>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #1: DUR (Drug Utilization Review)</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy and/or payer detects a DUR event related to the written product, the pharmacy can send an <span style="font-style: italic;">Rx Change Request </span>– Therapeutic Interchange to the prescriber requesting a switch to an alternative drug that will treat the condition with lesser or no adverse effects. Possible interactions include: allergies, dose alerts, drug interactions, and drug diseases.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>REQ-010 &lt;ChangeRequestType&gt; = T</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use DRU-100 &lt;DrugUseEvaluation&gt; of the medication prescribed segment to document further explanation, conflict, or clarification of services related to drug use evaluation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use DRU-090 &lt;Note&gt; of the medication prescribed segment to indicate DUR event.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #2: Formulary Compliance Change to an On Formulary or Preferred Drug</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy receives a claim reject (or even paid) message which identifies preferred alternative drugs which may have a lower copay for a patient, the pharmacy can send an <span style="font-style: italic;">Rx Change Request </span>– Therapeutic Interchange to the prescriber requesting a switch to one of the preferred products.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>REQ-010 &lt;ChangeRequestType&gt; = T</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use DRU-090 &lt;Note&gt; of the medication prescribed to indicate Formulary Compliance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #3: Days Supply Change From 30 Days to 90 Days Supply</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy receives a prescription indicating a 30-day supply, but the pharmacy determines that the patient has a 90-day benefit, the pharmacy can send an Rx Change Request – Therapeutic Interchange to the prescriber requesting a switch to a 90-day supply.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>REQ-010 &lt;ChangeRequestType&gt; = T</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use DRU-090 &lt;Note&gt; of the medication prescribed segment to indicate Days Supply.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #4: Therapy Change – Daily Dose Optimization</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy receives a prescription indicating a one 10 MG Tablet twice a day, but the patient desires to take one 20 MG tablet once a day, the pharmacy can send an Rx Change Request – Therapeutic Interchange to the prescriber requesting a switch to one 20 MG Tablet once a day.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>REQ-010 &lt;ChangeRequestType&gt; = T</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #5: Script Clarification</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy is unsure of the prescriber's intent; e.g. Prozac weekly once a day for 200 MG versus 20 MG which looks like a prescriber error. The pharmacy can send an Rx Change – Therapeutic Interchange to the prescriber requesting clarification.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>REQ-010 &lt;ChangeRequestType&gt; = T</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use the Medication Requested segment to indicate what the pharmacy thought the prescriber intended.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Use2"></a>Use Cases – Generic Substitution (Rx Change Request Type = G)</h3>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #1: Switching From Brand To Generic</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy receives a prescription which indicates Substitution not allowed, but a generic is available, the pharmacy can send an Rx Change Request – Generic Substitution to the prescriber requesting that the generic be allowed to be dispensed.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #2: New Generic Available</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy received the original prescription, it was written for a brand drug with no generic alternatives. The prescriber indicates substitution not allowed. During the course of therapy, a generic becomes available; the pharmacy can send an Rx Change Request – Generic Substitution to the prescriber requesting that the generic be allowed to be dispensed.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Use Case #3: Brand Not Covered</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the pharmacy received the original prescription, it was written for a brand drug and the prescriber indicated substitution not allowed.

        <ol>
            <li>Notes specific to the reason for the request should go in the prescribed drug segment as defined in the use cases above. Notes specific to all drugs requested should go on the first requested drug segment.</li>
            <li>The COO Benefit segment should be included so the prescriber knows which payer the pharmacist is using to determine coverage/pricing.</li>
            <li>If the Rx Change for Therapeutic Interchange or Generic Substitution is approved, this replaces the original Rx. The prescriber should create a new PON (prescriber order number); the old one becomes inactive for this approval. If the Rx Change for Prior Authorization is approved, the original prescription can still be used.</li>
            <li>A (RxChange) denial does not make the prescription invalid or stop therapy. If the prescriber wishes to stop therapy, the prescriber should send a cancel message for the original NewRx.</li>
            <li>An Approved with Changes Response (RES-010 = C) should not be used for Prior Authorization request; it has been removed in a future version of SCRIPT.</li>
            <li>Even though the request segment is optional, it should be sent to identify the type of request and it also should be returned on the response.</li>
            <li>A pharmacy may send an Rx Change Request for controlled substances (EPCS) regardless of whether the prescriber is setup for the EPCS service. For approvals, when received, if the prescriber is not enabled for the EPCS service, the prescriber should deny the electronic request with status type "denied" and indicate in the free text field that the denial will be followed by a written or telephoned prescription order. If the prescriber is set up for the EPCS service they can approve the change request as stated in the requirements. Denials should occur as stated above in Section 5.3 for the specific use case that applies.</li>
            <li>The free text field (RES-040) should be accessible for entry and accessible for prescriber viewing (added per advisory group notes).</li>
            <li>If the prescriber approves the change response it should be treated just like a new prescription. With a change response there are no limits or requirements around what can or cannot change in the message like there are on a renewal response. The pharmacy system should absorb the response data like they would on a new prescription in order to capture all the necessary information the prescriber sent.</li>
