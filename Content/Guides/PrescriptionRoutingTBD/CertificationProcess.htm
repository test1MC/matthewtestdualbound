        <p class="BodyText1">The Certification Phase includes more detailed testing of the messages through your user interface to ensure that it meets all Surescripts requirements. Surescripts assigns your organization a Certification Project Manager for working through the completion of certification testing. Surescripts provides a detailed plan outlining the necessary milestones for certification and moving into production. Once your organization passes certification, it is ready for transitioning to production.</p>
