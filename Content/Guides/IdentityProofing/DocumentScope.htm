        <p class="BodyText1">This document is intended to be used for e-prescribing products. These requirements are in addition to those requirements that are product/service-specific and are mandated in Surescripts product implementation guides. Vendors can choose whether to extend the requirementss to all components of the Electronic Health Record (EHR)/Electronic Medical Record (EMR). </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The requirements in this document do not directly meet EPCS requirements; however, the <a href="Tier1IDP_Requirements.htm#Knowledge_based_authentication">Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)</a> section of this document can support the foundation for those (EPCS) requirements. Participants currently ID proofing at a certified EPCS level are following NIST level 3 two-factor authentication requirements, which supersede the requirements set forth in this document. </p>
