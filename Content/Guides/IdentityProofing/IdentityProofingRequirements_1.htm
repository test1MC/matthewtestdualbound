        <p class="BodyText1">This document presents requirements for all prescriber participants connecting to the Surescripts® network for e-prescribing transactions. Surescripts offers a choice of three identity (ID) proofing requirement tiers. Participants must select the tier that meets their business model. Surescripts requires adoption of these requirements to meet the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, as well as signed contracts.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The requirements defined in this document consist of procedural and technical steps that can be implemented to support ID Proofing to align with the NIST standards. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">These requirements are in addition to those requirements that are product/service-specific and are mandated in specific Surescripts product implementation guides.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">All of the requirements in the participant's chosen tier must be met in order for a participant to access the Surescripts production network.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Key Points of ID-Proofing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ID proofing <span style="font-style: italic;text-decoration: underline;">may not</span> be determined based on an organization's prior relationship with an individual.</li>
            <li>Entities choose the tier they will certify against, based on tier definition and business model within each e-prescribing product/service. </li>
            <li>Apply only to non-controlled substances. E-prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS) must conform to the DEA requirements.</li>
            <li>The tiers are characterized by the relationship between the organization's application and potential users that will be ID proofed.</li>
        </ul>
