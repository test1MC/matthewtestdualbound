        <p class="BodyText1">For timeouts, consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When sending a message to Surescripts, the initiator should set the http timeout to no less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>A receiving system must reply with a valid success/failure response within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>When configured for Delivery Notification Tracking, a receiving system must follow-up with a DSN: Success/DSN: Failure within 55 minutes, because Surescripts may return a timeout error.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">DSN Successes or DSN Failures are not prevented from being delivered after 60 min and could still be sent after this time.</p>
