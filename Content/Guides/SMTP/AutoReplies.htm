        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts recommends that all receiving systems accept all attachment types; however, some receiving systems are unable to accept all file attachment types. Therefore, Surescripts only delivers attachments that the receiving system can receive.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">As a service, Surescripts generates an auto-reply, which indicates that the message was successfully delivered with all attachments the receiving system accepts. The auto-reply also lists each removed attachment.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Customer A sends a message with two attachments (CDA and PDF) to Customer B, whose system does not support PDF attachments. Surescripts sends an Auto-Reply message notifying Customer A that the message was delivered successfully with the PDF attachment dropped.</p>
