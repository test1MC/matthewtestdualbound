        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="1">After a patient’s eligibility has been determined, this transaction is used to retrieve a listing of dispensed medications that were paid for by a patient’s PBM or that were dispensed at a pharmacy. For pharmacy fill data, the participant may retrieve medication history regardless of patient eligibility.</p>
