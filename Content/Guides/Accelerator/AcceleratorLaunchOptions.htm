            Launch by provider or by patient is controlled by the “provider” or “patient” section being included in the Auth Token Request. These roles are then encoded in the Auth Token and used when querying for tasks.</p>

TaskNames that may require action on part of the prescriber (or their proxy) include: “Complete PA Form” and “Acknowledge” tasks (e.g. “Acknowledge Closed PA”).</p>
