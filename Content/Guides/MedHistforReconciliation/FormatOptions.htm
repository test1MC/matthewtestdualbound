        <p class="BodyText1">Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML now plays an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere. NCPDP has approved the XML representation of the SCRIPT standard and this guide includes the related XML tags. More information on XML can be obtained at: <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/XML/</a>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The Surescripts XML schema is available to all network customers and can be obtained as a supplemental file to this document by sending a request to your Implementation Project Manager or your Account Manager/Executive.</p>
