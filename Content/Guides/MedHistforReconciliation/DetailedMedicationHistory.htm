            <li>Surescripts attempts to locate patient. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If patient is not found, Surescripts sends Medication History Response back to the requester indicating the patient was not found.</li><li>If patient is found, the process continues per Step 4.</li></ol></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">The request is routed to the appropriate PBM/payer(s) for processing. For fill data, the request is handled internally using the pharmacy database.</li>
