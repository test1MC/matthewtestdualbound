        <p class="BodyText1">The Surescripts certification process ensures that customer software can send and receive electronic messages in accordance with industry standards and that it provides open choice for medication selection and dispensing location. In addition, Surescripts certification focuses on patient safety, efficiency of the electronic prescribing process and ease of use by end-users.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts certification testing focuses on message format, application workflow, and display in accordance with Surescripts Implementation Guides and the associated Application Certification Requirements (ACR) document noted in <MadCap:xref href="Document References.htm">Document References on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>. By holding all customers accountable for meeting the ACRs, our customers can send and receive the highest quality messages as e-prescribing and clinical messaging continue to progress overall as an industry.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Requirements that are enforced as part of the production code are denoted as “must” and will need to be met in order to successfully complete certification. “Should” is used for guidance or best practices. See the following chart for terminology usage in this implementation guide.</p>

        <p class="BodyText1">The following general best practices apply to all prescription routing message types.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If customers implement any type of prescription message store and forward methodology, e.g. hub or central location, the storage/hold time period should be no more than 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>To maximize the use of electronic transmission, customers should default to electronically send within their application workflow when the receiver is electronically enabled.</li>
            <li>Application should not duplicate messages; i.e. electronically delivered as well as faxed.</li>
            <li>Applications should have the ability to send ICD-9 or ICD-10 information in all message types. This is because ICD-9/ICD-10 coding is required on some electronic claims. If the information is not included, it could result in a manual process between the provider and pharmacy.</li>
