        <p class="BodyText1">Faxable Error Messages (FEM) service delivers non-controlled substances via facsimile (FAX) when they cannot be delivered electronically due to temporary/transient transmission failures, unless prohibited by state law. Surescripts creates an acknowledgement (Status-000) and delivers it back to the sending customer when putting the message in a fax queue. The sending customer will receive verification (Verify-010) when the fax is successfully delivered or an Error if fax delivery fails.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">In previous versions Surescripts faxed controlled substance prescriptions back to the prescriber for a wet signature. For EPCS, this feature will no longer be supported. If a prescription for a controlled substance cannot be delivered electronically, the sending customer will receive an Error.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Currently Surescripts only supports faxing for NewRx, Refill Renewal Request and Refill Renewal Response within Prescription Routing.</p>
