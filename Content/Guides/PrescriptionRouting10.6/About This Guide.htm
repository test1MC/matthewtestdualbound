        <p class="BodyText1"><span style="font-style: italic;">LTC</span> – Long Term Care is a variety of services which help meet both the medical and non-medical needs of people with a chronic illness or disability who cannot care for themselves for long periods of time.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Provider of the prescription order</span> – in the context of the RxFill message, may refer to the physician, prescriber, an agent acting on behalf of the prescriber, or the system they use.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dispensed</span> – in the context of the RxFill message, indicates the medication is no longer in the possession of the pharmacy and has been handed, shipped, or delivered to the patient (or the patient’s caregiver/representative). If the medication is still located in the pharmacy, it is not yet ‘dispensed’.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Prescriber</span> – for LTC this is the provider of the prescription order.</p>
