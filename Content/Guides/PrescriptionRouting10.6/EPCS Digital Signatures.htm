        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="Section 1: "><a name="_EPCS_Digital_Signatures"></a><a name="_Toc443643390"></a>EPCS Digital Signatures</h1>
        <p class="BodyText1">The Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances, Final Rule; 21 CFR Parts 1300, 1304, 1306, and 1311; Docket No. DEA-218; RIN 1117-AA61 defines requirements for digitally signing components of a prescription.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">This section only applies to messages sent with the digital signature that was created with the prescriber's individual private/signing key.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Pharmacies that receive Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances are required to support either one or both methods: Digital Signature or the Digital Signature Flag (see <MadCap:xref href="DRU Drug Segment.htm#DRU_110">DRU-110 on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>). Because these pharmacies are not required to support both methods, prescribing systems should not assume that all EPCS-enabled pharmacies will be able to receive prescriptions in the method used by the prescriber. However, we recommend pharmacies support both methods.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Messages signed with an application signature MAY NOT use the digital signature element in the header; instead, the digital signature indicator "SI" in the drug coverage status field (DRU-110) IS REQUIRED TO BE USED.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">This section describes the method for signing discrete elements which will be supported in both XML and for EDIFACT messages. This method will be supported by customers planning to exchange messages using end-to-end Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Both XML and EDIFACT utilize an XML wrapper, which is where the Digital Signature structure is stored.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The signature methodology has been defined to support information exchange between XML to XML, XML to EDIFACT, EDIFACT to XML, and EDIFACT to EDIFACT allowing all EPCS certified customers to exchange regardless of message format.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substance messages that do not include a digital signature created with the prescriber's individual private/signing key but instead have the digital signature indicator "SI", will be digitally signed and archived by the Surescripts network. The Surescripts digital signature will NOT be attached to the message, and will not alter the message contents. The cryptographic module used has been validated at FIPS 140–2 Security Level 1. The digital signature application and hash function used comply with FIPS 186–3 and FIPS 180–3. The electronic prescription application's private key is stored encrypted on a FIPS 140–2 Security Level 1 validated cryptographic module using a FIPS approved encryption algorithm. The archive is retained electronically for at least two years.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts network pharmacies receiving EPCS messages that do not include a digital signature created with the prescriber's individual private/signing key but instead have the digital signature indicator "SI" flag must ensure that they are compliant with §1311.210 (a) (2) of the DEA's Interim Final Rule, i.e., "(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a copy of each electronic controlled substance prescription record that a pharmacy receives must be digitally signed by one of the following: (2) The first pharmacy application that receives the electronic prescription must digitally sign the prescription immediately on receipt." It is important to note that as a consequence of this requirement, Surescripts does not generate and forward to pharmacies digital signatures for EPCS messages as would be required if §1311.210 (a) (1) were being followed.</p>
