        <h1 class="Heading1"> Messages Overview</h1>
        <p class="BodyText1">This section provides guidelines for the data messaging interfaces between the prescriber system and the pharmacy. Some message flows include the utilization of LTPAC information. LTPAC is a variety of settings and services which help meet both the medical and non-medical needs of people with a chronic illness or disability who cannot care for themselves for long periods of time.</p>

                <li>Messages marked with one asterisk (*) are fillable messages. A fillable message is a message from the prescriber or prescribing system to the pharmacy that results in an initial prescription being filled, a change approval, or a refill approval. Other messages may support fillable messages or workflows.</li>
                <li>Messages marked with two asterisks (**) only apply to LTC.</li>

        <p class="BodyText1">The following steps depict the basic workflow of a prescriber initiated message:</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-top: 8pt;color: #000000;">Prescriber initiates a message for a patient via a prescriber system and transmits to Surescripts.</li>
            <li>Surescripts validates the message:  <ul><li>If there is an issue with the message, Surescripts returns an Error back to the prescriber system and the process ends. </li></ul></li>
            <li>If no error in validation occurs, Surescripts routes the message to the appropriate pharmacy system.  </li>
            <li>The pharmacy system then validates the message and responds with a synchronous Status message (Code of either 000 or 010) or an Error to Surescripts.</li>
            <li>Surescripts sends the synchronous response to the prescriber system:&#160; <ul><li>If either the Status message (Code 010) or Error are returned, then the process ends. </li></ul></li>
            <li>If the synchronous message is a Status (Code 000) message, then the pharmacy system follows up with an asynchronous (free standing) Verify message (Code 010) or Error.</li>
            <li style="color: #000000;">When Surescripts receives either the Verify or Error, the message is validated and forwarded to the prescriber system and the workflow is complete.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc513714468"></a>Pharmacy Message Workflow</h2>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">An asynchronous (free standing) Verify message shall only used after a Status message (Code 000).</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc513714469"></a>NewRx</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">The NewRx message was developed using the NCPDP SCRIPT standard. A Status, Error, or Verify response is always sent after a NewRx message. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714470"></a>NewRx EPCS Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For CS-II only, one dispense event is permitted per the DEA IFR. This means on a New Rx for a CS-II, the refill value must be equal to "0" (zero). Prescribers desiring to send a subsequent NewRx prescription(s) will send NewRxs with an effective date set 30 days, 60, days, 90 days, etc. in the future and the refill value on each will be set to "0" (zero). </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_NewRx_LTC_Requirements"></a><a name="_Toc513714471"></a>NewRx LTC Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An open order is defined by specific usage of the medication quantity elements.&#160; An open order must have a medication CodeListQualifier = "QS" and use the corresponding quantity value = "0" (zero).&#160; Open orders are dependent on regulatory expiration and audit processes in LTPAC settings and services.&#160; </li>
            <li>Open orders must not be sent for controlled substances when regulatory mandates apply. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714472"></a>NewRx LTC Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prescriber initiated Change Process for LTC can be found in the <a href="#_Toc513714483">Prescriber Initiated Change Process for LTC - Requirements/Best Practices</a> section. </li>
            <li>OrderCaptureMethod should be used in all instances of NewRxs for LTPAC settings and services. </li>
            <li>Facility element information should be sent on all NewRx messages. <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>At a minimum, the Facility elements requires Identification. One or more Identification elements may be sent as needed, but at least one is required to be sent. Per NCPDP guidance in the Prescriber, Pharmacy and Facility Identifiers, the NPI is expected to be sent if one is known.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Patient Location fields for unit, room and bed are important to the pharmacy profile of a resident and should also be sent when known.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc513714473"></a>RxRenewal</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">An RxRenewalRequest is originated by the pharmacy. This message is for the purpose of requesting approval for additional refills of a prescription.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If a patient has approved refills remaining on a current prescription, no electronic message is required for a dispensing to occur.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">An RxRenewalResponse is sent by the prescriber to the pharmacy in response to a request to refill a prescription. The response indicates whether the RxRenewalRequest has been Approved, Approved with Changes, Denied, or Replace. An Approved, Approved with Changes, or Replace response is an indication to the pharmacy to discontinue dispensing the original prescription and instead begin dispensing the new prescription. In this case, a CancelRx is not sent for the original prescription following the RxRenewalResponse.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"> The RxRenewalResponse no longer contains a MedicationPrescribed or a MedicationDispensed element, as it did in lower versions. The MedicationResponse element contains the medication information that the prescriber is approving within an RxRenewalResponse. The Approved, ApprovedWithChanges or Replace RxRenewalResponse is considered a fillable message.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714474"></a>RxRenewal Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fillable RxRenewalResponse messages for controlled substance medications must be digitally signed. </li>
            <li>When sent, PharmacyRequestedRefills must not be "0" (zero). Do not send this element if you want to allow the prescriber to determine appropriate number of refills.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714475"></a>RxRenewal Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The RxRenewalRequest contains a MedicationPrescribed and a MedicationDispensed loop. The MedicationDispensed element is the required element to be used per the RxRenewalRequest schema. In order to support the translation of messages between versions, both loops should be present. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText3">Examples:</p>
        <p class="BodyText3">NewRx sent by prescriber with substitutions allowed.</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">MedicationPrescribed: Lipitor 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">NumberOfRefills: 1</p>
        <p class="BodyText3">Pharmacy dispenses Atorvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">Pharmacy sends an RxRenewalRequest with the following information</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">MedicationPrescribed: Lipitor 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">NumberOfRefills: 1</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">MedicationDispensed: Atorvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">PharmacyRequestedRefills: 2</p>
        <p class="BodyText3">Prescriber approves (based upon MedicationDispensed) and sends an RxRenewalResponse</p>
        <p class="BodyText3">Response type Approved:</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">MedicationResponse: Atorvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">NumberOfRefills:2</p>
        <p class="BodyText3">Response type ApprovedWithChanges:</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">MedicationResponse: Atorvastatin 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">NumberOfRefills:6</p>
        <p class="BodyText3">Response type Replace:</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">MedicationResponse: Lipitor 10 MG Oral Tablet</p>
        <p class="BodyText2">NumberOfRefills: 2</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-EPCS</span> authorized prescriber receives an RxRenewalRequest for a controlled substance, they respond with a Denied message to the pharmacy. Should the prescriber wish to approve the request without having the "ControlledSubstance" service level enabled, they may then continue with their non-Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) workflow as determined by their application.</li>
            <li>The NDC/ProductCode in the RxRenewalRequest should not be the sole determination of the identification of the requested medication. When the incoming NDC does not match the related NewRx or cannot be found, systems should use other potential identifiers (e.g. RxNorm codes) and must always allow manual review of the drug description by the user. Therefore, all response types should be permitted (i.e. approved, approved with changes, denied, replace).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">For more information on how to send a Follow Up Request, see the <a href="ElementUsage.htm#_Follow_Up_Request">Follow Up Request Requirements</a> section.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="RxRenewa"></a>RxRenewal Prescriber Best Practices</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Prescribers should review all requests. Prescribers should not delete a request message from a processing queue without a response being generated to the requestor.</li>
            <li>Matching a request back to an original message is not required to present the RxRenewalRequest to the Prescriber. See the Message Linkage section for more details.</li>
            <li>If another prescriber is responding to an RxRenewalRequest for non-controlled substances on the original prescriber's behalf (i.e., original prescriber who is out of the office), then one of the following options should be used.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Option A – Using PrescribingAgent – If the prescriber is out for a short time, then the prescriber field in the RxRenewalResponse should contain the prescriber's name, but the PrescribingAgent element should contain the name of the agent that is authorized to approve/deny refills for the prescriber.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Option B – If the original prescriber is unable to respond, the original RxRenewalRequest should be responded to with the RxRenewalResponse type of Replace. The new prescriber information should be populated in the Prescriber elements. Additionally, the new prescriber’s SPI should be sent in the From element of the message header. If needed, the original prescriber information can be sent in the FollowUpPrescriber elements.  </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="RxRenewa2"></a>RxRenewal Pharmacy Best Practices</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If the prescriber has not responded within 72 hours the FollowUpRequest workflow should be utilized. See <a href="#_RxRenewal_LTC_Best"><span class="Hyperlink" style="font-size: 11pt;">RxRenewal LTC Best Practices</span></a> section for exception information.</li>
            <li>A pharmacy may send an RxRenewalRequest for controlled substances regardless of whether the prescriber has the "ControlledSubstance" service level.</li>
            <li>For RxRenewal routing:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Retain the original sending SPI for the electronically received NewRx. Evaluate this SPI (e.g., has Refill service level), and send RxRenewalRequest to this record.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Prescribers are allowed to have multiple SPI, it is important to ensure that when sending an RxRenewal the correct SPI is selected based on service level and location. For example confirm the Individual NPI, Address Line 1 or Address Line 2, Postal Code, Phone Fax, or Clinic Name prior to sending the message.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714476"></a>RxRenewal EPCS Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For CS-II only, one dispense event is permitted per the DEA IFR. This means on the RxRenewalResponse for a CS-II the MedicationResponse, the NumberOfRefills value shall be equal to one (1) on an Approved or Approved with Changes response type.</li>
            <li>RxRenewalResponse type Replace must not be sent for controlled substances when the receiver uses a lower version because of the inability to translate the DigitalSignature. Instead prescribers should deny and follow up with a new prescription. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_RxRenewal_LTC_Best"></a><a name="_Toc513714477"></a>RxRenewal LTC Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>RxRenewal requests may be generated as an option for open orders that have hit their regulatory expiratory limit.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Prescribers in the LTPAC industry may not respond to RxRenewal Requests in a care setting for up to 30 days. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc513714478"></a>RxChange</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">An RxChangeRequest message is originated by the pharmacy to request a change to a new or fillable prescription. Response types for RxChange are Approved, ApprovedWithChanges, Denied, and Validated. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">An RxChangeRequest may be sent with the following MessageRequest codes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“G”, may be used to request a prescriber allow the dispensing of a generic medication.</li>
            <li>“P”, may be used to request a prescriber review the drug requested and obtain a prior authorization from the payer for the existing prescription.</li>
            <li>“T”, may be used to request a prescriber authorize a therapy change to the original prescription.</li>
            <li>“D”, may be used to request a prescriber authorize a change to an alternative medication that will have fewer, or no, adverse effects than the original prescription.</li>
            <li>“S”, may be used to request a prescriber clarify the original prescription.</li>
            <li>“OS”, may be used to request a prescriber authorize a change to the original prescription due to the pharmacy being out of stock of the requested medication.</li>
            <li>
                <p>“U”, may be used to request prescriber authorization information, such as confirming their DEA number or enrollment with the prescription benefit plan. The “Validated” RxChangeResponse type is only used when responding to this type of request.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714479"></a>RxChange Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An RxChangeResponse type of ApprovedWithChanges cannot be used in response to an RxChangeRequest with a MessageRequestCode of "P" (Prior Authorization).</li>
            <li>MedicationPrescribed is required when an RxChange response is Approved or ApprovedWithChanges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714480"></a>RxChange Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>At least one loop of the MedicationRequested loop should be sent, unless the use cases are for PriorAuthorization (P) or PrescriberAuthorization (U).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The MedicationRequested loop utilizes discrete fields to provide the requested changes and the Note field to provide additional information that is not captured discretely for that loop.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Approved responses are utilized when one of the MedicationRequested loops is echoed in the MedicationPrescribed loop of the RxChangeResponse with no changes to the requested elements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Approved with Changes responses are used when there are changes other than what was requested.  The Approved with Changes response is considered a new fillable prescription and indicates to the pharmacy that the in process prescription should no longer be dispensed and should be cancelled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Prescriber vendors utilizing Surescripts Prior Authorization should optimize workflows by automatically triggering a PAInitiationRequest when they receive an RxChangeRequest for prior authorization and an RxChangeResponse upon receipt of a prior authorization approval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714481"></a>RxChange LTC Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>LTPAC settings and services do not always have prescribers available to approve or deny changes when initiated by a pharmacy which can make it difficult to support the RxChange messages. In many cases, facilities and pharmacies generally have contracts that apply to generic and therapeutic substitutions. RxFill is used in many cases to communicate when substitutions are made. If there is a pharmacy requested change to a prescribed therapy that is beyond a substitution and RxChange is not supported, an alternative method of communication is recommended.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Prescriber Initiated Change Process is used for prescribers to alter existing therapies and utilizes a NewRx &gt; CancelRx &gt; NewRx process with appropriate message linking and MessageRequestCode field indicators. This process is outlined in the CancelRx section. Appropriate message linking and field population as outlined in the CancelRx section.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc513714482"></a>CancelRx and CancelRx Response</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">The CancelRx is used to notify the pharmacy that a previously sent prescription should be cancelled and not filled. The message is originated by the prescriber system as a CancelRx. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The CancelRxResponse is sent from the pharmacy to the prescriber system in response to a CancelRx.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714483"></a>Prescriber Initiated Change Process for LTC - Requirements/Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">R.208:</span> In LTPAC prescriber systems, when making a prescription change using a NewRx, a MessageRequestCode and OrderCaptureMethod shall be used to identify the type of change and the source of the data. These fields shall be present in both the CancelRx and the subsequent NewRx. </li>
            <li>The ChangeOfPrescriptionStatusFlag should contain the appropriate code for canceling a medication that has not been dispensed or discontinuing an active order. </li>
            <li>Scenarios for Prescriber-Initiated Changes are as follows:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>A data entry error is corrected by a prescriber or an agent of a prescriber and a CancelRx is sent with a subsequent NewRx.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>A prescriber alters a course of therapy after making a clinical decision regarding a medication and sends the pharmacy a CancelRx followed by a subsequent NewRx.</li></ul></li>
            <li>CancelRx should contain a CodeListQualifier value of "QS" and Quantity of "0" when discontinuing an open order. </li>
            <li>CancelRx and CancelRxResponse should also be accompanied by a ChangeOfPrescriptionStatusFlag. This is used on the CancelRx to indicate prescriber knowledge of dispensing/administering activity, and on the CancelRxResponse to indicate the pharmacy acknowledgement of dispensing process.&#160; </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListBullet2" style="margin-left: 54pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Values</span>: </p>

        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Toc513714484"></a>Fill Messages</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">RxFill messages are used to provide prescribers with information regarding dispensing activity for a prescription. Additionally, prescribers may select the types of notifications they desire over the life of the prescription.&#160; </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">To optimize use of the RxFill transaction, both prescriber and pharmacy systems utilizing the RxFill messages must support the RxFillIndicator element and the RxFillIndicatorChange message. For prescriber systems, support of the RxFillIndicator element includes setting the desired value in prescriber initiated messages such as NewRx, RxRenewalResponse, RxChangeResponse, and Resupply. For pharmacy systems, this includes sending fill status notifications based on the indications selected by the prescriber as well as adding or altering preferred notification types when the RxFillIndicatorChange is utilized.&#160; </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Pharmacy systems must be able to support the following fill status types: Dispensed, PartiallyDispensed, and NotDispensed. Support for sending a fill status of Transferred is required when the pharmacy system also supports the RxTransfer message.&#160; While the use of Reason Codes or Notes is optional to send in RxFill messages, pharmacy systems are strongly encouraged to support the inclusion of these additional elements.&#160; </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714485"></a>Fill Status Workflow and Scenarios</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Prescribers initiate the process of requesting fill status messages through the use of RxFillIndicator in prescriber initiated messages. The pharmacy then tracks the desired indications. The prescribers may add or alter selected fill status options when sending subsequent prescriber initiated messages. Additionally, prescribers have the ability to send an RxFillIndicatorChange message to request alterations to preferred fill status notifications. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The following scenarios are examples of how the RxFillIndicator and RxFillIndicatorChange message can be used. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scenario 1</span> – Prescriber opts into receiving RxFill notifications and then alters preferred selection: </p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">In the context of an RxFill message, ‘dispensed’ indicates the medication is no longer in the possession of the pharmacy and has been handed, shipped, or delivered to the patient (or the patient’s caregiver/representative). If the medication is still located in the pharmacy, it is not yet ‘dispensed’.</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Fillable messages and Resupply should contain the RxFillIndicator if RxFill messages are desired.&#160; </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">In order to receive fill status notifications the prescriber or prescriber system sets the preferred fill status options on each fillable message and Resupply.</li>
            <li>Send Facility NPI in the Identification element when known. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Toc513714488"></a>LTC Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>RxFill messages are designed to be sent based on the prescriber indication. When a prescription is sent to a pharmacy via non-electronic means (e.g. fax), the pharmacy will not have an indication of what types of fill status notifications the prescriber desires. In the LTPAC care setting, there is still a need to receive an RxFill message for prescriptions sent via a non-electronic method. Partnership agreements often allow and/or require RxFill messages to be sent, regardless of the method in which the pharmacy received the prescription.&#160; </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Resupply messages include the ability to alter selected RxFillIndicator preferences. <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li style="font-weight: normal;">If no RxFillIndicator element is indicated in the Resupply message, no change would be made to previous preferences.&#160; </li></ul></li>

        <p class="BodyText1">The following workflows depict various scenarios where Verify, Error, and Status are sent in response to a NewRx request. Note that for all of these scenarios, NewRx could be any of the following messages: RxRenewalRequest, RxRenewalResponse, RxFill, RxChangeRequest, RxChangeResponse, CancelRx, and CancelRxResponse.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Customers must support all messages as described in the <a href="#_Toc513714493">Acknowledgement Message Table</a>. Every message workflow ends with Status (Code 010), Verify, or Error.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 1 – Message errors at Surescripts</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">1a). A NewRx is sent.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">1b). Surescripts receives the NewRx.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">1c). Surescripts does not recognize the format of the message, or errors are contained within the message, and returns an Error or error text to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 2 – Message is acknowledged successfully by recipient</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">2a). A NewRx is sent.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">2b). Surescripts forwards the message to the receiving customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">2c). Receiving customer validates the message and returns a Status (Code 010) to Surescripts.&#160; This indicates the message was accepted by the ultimate receiver.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">2d). Surescripts forwards the Status (Code 010) back to the sending customer. </p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 3 – Message errors at Receiver</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">3a). A NewRx is sent.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">3b). Surescripts forwards the message to the receiving customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">3c). Receiving customer either does not recognize the format of the message, or errors are contained within the message, and returns an Error message or error text to Surescripts.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">3d). Surescripts sends an Error to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 4 – Status 000 followed by an Error</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4a). A NewRx is sent.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4b). Surescripts forwards the message to the receiving customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4c). Receiving customer validates the message and returns a pending Status (Code 000) to Surescripts. This indicates that the message has been received but processing is not yet complete and the message has not reached its ultimate destination.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4d). Surescripts forwards the Status (Code 000) back to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4e). Receiving customer encounters an error when processing the message and initiates a new Error (sometimes referred to as a "Free-Standing Error").</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Surescripts may convert the message to fax and avoid sending the error back to the sending customer. See the <a href="#_Toc513714496">Faxing</a> section for more information.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4f). Surescripts forwards the Error to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4g). Sending customer acknowledges the Error by sending back a verified Status (Code 010) to Surescripts. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">4h). Surescripts forwards the verified Status (Code 010) to the receiving customer.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 5 – Status 000 followed by a Verify</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5a). A NewRx is sent to Surescripts.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5b). Surescripts forwards the message to the receiving customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5c). Receiving customer validates the message and sends back a Status (Code 000) to Surescripts. This indicates that the message has been received, but processing is not yet complete and the message has not reached its ultimate destination.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5d). Surescripts forwards the Status (Code 000) back to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5e). Receiving customer delivers the NewRx to the end point and initiates a new Verify (sometimes referred to as a "Free-Standing Verify").</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5f). Surescripts forwards the Verify to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5g). Sending customer acknowledges the Verify by sending back a Status (Code 010) to Surescripts. Code 010 indicates it was accepted by the ultimate receiver.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">5h). Surescripts forwards the Status (Code 010) to the receiving customer.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">Scenario 6 – Connectivity Error with receiving customer</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6a). A NewRx is sent to Surescripts.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6b). Surescripts attempts to forward the message to the receiving customer, but is unable to connect and receives an HTTP error or the connection times out after 24 seconds.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6c). Surescripts sends back a Status (Code 000) to the sending customer. This indicates that the message has been received, but processing is not yet complete and the message has not reached its ultimate destination.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6d) Surescripts makes up to 3 additional delivery attempts with a delay of at least 1 minute, 5 minutes and then 10 minutes between each attempt.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6e). If one of the delivery attempts is successful and the receiving customer returns a Status (000), Surescripts will audit the response, but it will not deliver that recent Status (000) to the sending customer as they have already received one from Surescripts in step 6c.&#160; Final status will be sent to the sending customer once the recipient sends a free standing Error or Verify as in steps 4e and 5e above.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6f). If one of the delivery attempts is successful and the receiving customer returns a Status (010), Surescripts will convert the Status (010) into a Free Standing Verify and deliver the Verify to the sending customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6g). Sending customer acknowledges the Verify by sending back a Status (Code 010) to Surescripts. Code 010 indicates it was accepted by the ultimate receiver.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">6h). If one of the delivery attempts is successful and the receiving customer returns an Error, Surescripts will forward the Error to the sending customer.</p>
