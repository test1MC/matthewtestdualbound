        <h2 class="Heading2">Attachments</h2>
        <p MadCap:changes="1" class="BodyText1">Attachments serve as a way for PBM/payers to substantiate some prior authorization determinations and may be required in some instances. Surescripts strongly recommends that provider vendors support the ability to electronically send PDF attachments at a minimum.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Attachment types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TIFF</li>
            <li>PNG</li>
            <li>JPEG</li>
            <li>PDF</li>
            <li>CDA</li>
            <li>CCR</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">Only send an attachment if the question set specifically asks for it. If you do not receive a request for an attachment, do not send one. Sending unnecessary attachments may result in manual review and delays. Message size (including attachments) is limited to a maximum of 20MB.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">PBM/payers and provider vendors should allow users to view and send PDFs, at a minimum, to keep the prior authorization workflow electronic. However, PBM/payers should populate the QuestionSet/Header/QuestionSetContactCommunicationNumber/Fax/Number field in ePA response messages so provider vendors know where to fax any requested attachments they are unable to send electronically.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If an attachment has to be sent through fax, the fax should include the PACaseID from the PAInitiationResponse to aid in linking it to the electronic messages. The provider vendor should also include in the QuestionSetComment field of the PARequest that they are faxing documentation. </p>
