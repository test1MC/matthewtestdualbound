        <h2 class="Heading2">Timing for Response</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">When the PBM/payer sends back a PAInitiationResponse they can provide a “Time to Process” the PARequest in the QuestionSetDescription or the PANote, which gives the provider vendor an estimate of when they will see the PAResponse. If the provider vendor does not receive a PAResponse within the estimated timeframe, the provider vendor should not send another message. Instead, the provider vendor should follow up with the PBM/payer manually (e.g., phone or fax).</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If the PBM/payer does not provide an estimated “Time to Process” the PARequest and the provider vendor has not received the PAResponse within 48 hours, the provider vendor should not send another message. Instead, the provider vendor should follow up with the PBM/payer via phone or fax.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">In cases where the PBM/payer communicates the status of the PARequest to the prescriber via phone or fax, the PBM/payer should always send a PAResponse to close the electronic conversation.</p>
