        <h2 class="Heading2">Directories</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">This section describes the process for customers to understand directory usage for ePA lookup and describes which model(s) are supported. More information on directories can be found in the Surescripts Directory 4.6 (or higher) Implementation Guide. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Provider vendors do not need to reference the Surescripts Directory to find PBM/payers with an ePA service level. However, provider vendors should still utilize the Directory in cases where the 271 does not indicate an active coverage, but the provider vendor still wants to initiate a prior authorization with a specific PBM/payer. Provider vendors will need to update directory service levels for their prescribers that use ePA.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="PBM/paye"></a>PBM/payer Directory Access</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">There are no points in the current ePA workflow where a PBM/payer must "look up" the routing information or service level of a PA message recipient. PBM/payers do not retrieve information from the directory in conjunction with ePA messaging. Each prior authorization workflow begins with the provider vendor sending a PAInitiationRequest to EPAINI and the PBM/payer/third party processor's response is addressed back to that initiating provider vendor.</p>
