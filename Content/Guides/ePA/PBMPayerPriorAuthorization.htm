        <h2 class="Heading2">PBM/Payer Prior Authorization Coverage Lists</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">As the Prior Authorization coverage list is the provider vendor’s primary means for knowing whether a drug needs prior authorization, PBM/payers should ensure that they are sending Prior Authorization coverage lists in their formulary files. This maximizes the ePA workflow and allows prior authorizations to be completed before the prescription arrives at the pharmacy.</p>
