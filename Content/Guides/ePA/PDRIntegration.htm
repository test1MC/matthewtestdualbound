        <h1 class="Heading1">PDR Integration</h1>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts has partnered with Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR) to provide prior authorization coverage for nearly 100 percent of patients on the Surescripts network. This coverage comes from Surescripts’ direct electronic connections to PBM/payers using CompletEPA<sup>®</sup> and PDR’s extensive forms library. For provider vendors that choose to implement with PDR, Surescripts will be able to return a link to a dynamic PDF form in cases where Surescripts cannot provide an electronic route to the prior authorization. See <MadCap:xref href="ElectronicPriorAuthorization.htm">Electronic Prior Authorization Message Flow</MadCap:xref>  for a detailed workflow outlining the process for invoking and returning a PDR form.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Provider vendors need to contract with PDR separately in order for Surescripts to return the URL to the PDR form. In the PANote field, Surescripts will send the PDR Url - [URL]. For example, PDR Url - http://www.google.com.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Due to security restrictions in place at some organizations, prescriber vendors and health systems should ensure that PDR URLs are added to a list of allowed (or whitelisted) sites. For details on specific URLs to be added, please work with your Surescripts Integration Project Manager.</p>
