        <h2 class="Heading2">Days Supply in PAInitiationRequests</h2>
        <p>In order to allow PBM/payers to provide the most accurate response, provider vendors should include DaysSupply for the requested medication within PAInitiationRequests. PBM/payers use days supply in order to determine if prescribers are requesting a quantity outside of the plan limit. Failure to provide days supply could result in unnecessary question sets being returned to prescribers or additional work.</p>
