        <h2 MadCap:changes="5" class="Appendix2">Electronic Appeals</h2>
        <p MadCap:changes="5" class="BodyText1">When a PBM/payer chooses to accept electronic appeals for a PA determination, they should make sure to provide as much detail as possible regarding the requirements that apply. This could include any of the following within the Appeal element:</p>
        <ul MadCap:changes="5">
            <li MadCap:changes="5">a descriptive PANote indicating specific information that may be needed from the prescriber in order to return an approved response</li>
            <li MadCap:changes="5">contact information for the PBM/payer that may indicate where a prescriber can reach out for information on the PA or appeal process</li>
            <li MadCap:changes="5">a discrete ExpirationDate that indicates the date after which an appeal will no longer be considered for the PA</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:changes="2">Automatically Initiating ePA for RxChange Messages</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="2">For RxChange messages, it is recommended to automatically initiate ePAs.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:changes="3">Re-Submitting and Re-Initiating ePAs</h2>
        <p MadCap:changes="3" class="BodyText1">It is recommended that provider vendors allow their users the ability to re-submit or re-initiate ePAs in the event of a PBM/payer processing error, or if the deadline for reply has passed. If the deadline has passed,  the open question set (PACancelRequest) will need to be cancelled and resubmitted the original PAInitiationRequest with a unique PAReferenceID.</p>
