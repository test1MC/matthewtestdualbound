        <h2 class="Heading2">NDC Codes</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">Provider vendors should send the Representative NDC of the drug, if available, in the PAInitiationRequest. The NDC is not required by the NCPDP standard, but PBM/payers may do additional validation on this field. Sending the NDC can help ensure that the drug can be easily identified in the PBM/payer system.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The most up to date NDC available for the requested drug should be sent based upon the drug database being utilized.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">PBM/payers should not expect that provider vendors are always populating the NDC in the PAInitiationRequest and should consider additional drug matching logic in cases when the NDC is not populated.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">For compounds, the NDC cannot be sent. This will be corrected in a future version of the standard.</p>
