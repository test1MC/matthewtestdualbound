        <p class="BodyText1">In the NCPDP SCRIPT standard there is no way for a PBM/payer to approve or deny a prior authorization without a completed question set.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The fields shown in the figure below are not used to indicate that the PBM/payer is approving the requested PA. They are only to be used in scenarios where the PBM/payer is indicating that the requested PA has already been approved. For example, if the PBM/payer has already approved the PA for the request they are receiving, they would send back a Closed response with a CF reason code. They could then include (optionally) the authorization details for that approved PA.</p>
