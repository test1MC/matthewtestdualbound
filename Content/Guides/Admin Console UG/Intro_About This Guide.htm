        <h1 class="Heading1">Introduction</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="About"></a>About This Guide</h2>
        <p class="BodyText1">This Guide was created to assist organization and provider vendor participants with an understanding of the Surescripts Admin Console, a proprietary Web application that provides an interface to information and transaction activity on the Surescripts network, including directory information – which can be synchronized with their systems, messaging history, and a testing platform.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Function"></a>Functionality</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">The Admin Console provides replicated visibility into the directories and messages that transmit across the Surescripts network. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The organization and provider directories that are included within the Admin Console provide the foundation for the transactions and also provide the vendor participants with the necessary tools and resources to maintain updated directory listings within their respective applications. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The messaging search functionality provided in the Admin Console allows the vendor participant to search and review transaction activity associated with their respective account in “near” real time. Currently, these transactions are limited to retail and mail-order based scripts, clinical message, directory message and limited medication history transaction activity that occurs on the Surescripts .net network.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Additional functionalities include reporting, case management integration, and account/portal setup review.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If you have questions concerning this guide or the Admin Console, please direct them to your Surescripts Account Manager or the Surescripts Customer Care Team at <a href="mailto:support@surescripts.com" target="_blank"><span class="Hyperlink" style="font-size: 11pt;">support@surescripts.com</span></a>.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Producti"></a>Production vs. Staging Environment</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Prior to certification on the Surescripts network, vendor participants will have used the staging version of the Admin Console. This test environment works under the same functionality as the production version of the Admin Console; it is provided to allow vendor participants the opportunity to test their application solutions in a controlled environment.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Once certified, vendor participant connectivity will be activated in the production version of the Admin Console; the production environment will display actual records and transactions.</p>
