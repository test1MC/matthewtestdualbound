        <p class="BodyText1">The Surescripts Self-Service Portal (SSP) provides a centralized process for case management. Vendor participants who connect directly to the Surescripts network will use the self-service portal to log and manage support-related cases and issues.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Vendor participants who connect to the Surescripts network through a gateway aggregator vendor will use support protocols as identified by their vendor. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Participant vendors may have an integration component applied to their Admin Console account that will enable them to log and manage, on a limited basis, support-related cases. This integration will link their Self-Service Portal account with their Admin Console account.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">To determine whether or not a vendor account has access, check the left menu bar for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case Management</span> button. If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case Management</span> button is not present and the vendor participant is a direct-connect to the Surescripts network, the participant should contact Surescripts Customer Care for assistance in establishing the link.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">There are two ways to log a case within the Admin Console: through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case Management</span> menu item, or through the details of a provider/organization/message detail record.</p>
