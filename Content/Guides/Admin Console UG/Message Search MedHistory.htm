        <p class="BodyText1">Within the Surescripts network there are two connections available to vendor participants to conduct medication history transactions. With the implementation of NCPDP Version 10.6, vendor participants will connect through the one Surescripts network. Those transactions will not be viewable within the Admin Console. For assistance with researching medication history transactions over the Surescripts network please contact Surescripts Customer Care.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Vendor participants that have not transitioned to 10.6 are still able to view Medication History message transactions in the Admin Console. To view, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Med Hist Msg Search</span> button. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Search for Message</span> Display screen appears. This screen includes the same searchable criteria as the Message Search as presented in <MadCap:xref href="Message Search_4.htm">Message Search  on page 1</MadCap:xref>; however, the available Message Types will be specific to Med History transactions.</p>
