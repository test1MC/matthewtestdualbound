        <p class="BodyText1">The Surescripts network consists of two database directories, Organization and Provider. Admin Console allows manual view, creation, and update to these directories, as well as the ability to download aggregate copies of the data. Specific functionality is outlined in the following sections.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Alternately, Surescripts provides the ability for the same functionality behind the scenes through Surescripts directory messaging. Directory messaging is a scripting interface directed through a common Surescripts' network portal and is recommended for large batches.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">For additional information on Surescripts directory messaging, refer to the appropriate version of the Surescripts Directories Guide for your account.</p>
