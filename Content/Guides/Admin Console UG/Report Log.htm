        <p class="BodyText1">Each month Surescripts will post to its participant vendors a series of standard reports designed to overview the previous month’s activity and metrics. Reports are available for up to 90 days, after which they are available by request from Surescripts Customer Care. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Not all reports may be available to all vendor participants and some custom reports are available. Please contact your account manager to discuss options for customizing a report.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">To access reports, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Log</span> button. Reports can be either opened for viewing or downloaded for future reference.</p>
