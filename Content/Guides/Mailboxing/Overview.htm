        <h2 class="Heading2">About Mailboxing</h2>
        <p>Mailboxing is a service offered to prescriber or pharmacy customers who cannot maintain persistent Internet connections with Surescripts. These customers are only able to connect to the Internet at various times to send and receive messages. Surescripts pushes electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) messages to customers that use persistent Internet connections and to those that do not. Surescripts prefers to push e-prescribing messages to customers using persistent Internet connections, and for customers to host HTTPS (Secure Web) services. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The prescriber and pharmacy customers without persistent Internet connections can use the Mailboxing service to send and retrieve messages at their convenience. The Mailboxing service stores (queues) messages in Surescripts mailboxes until the prescriber or pharmacy customers retrieve them by periodically polling the Surescripts gateway with an HTTPS post containing a <span class="code">GetMessage</span> message. The Mailboxing service does not affect how the prescriber or pharmacy sends and receives messages. Customers sending messages to a pharmacy or prescriber using a persistent Internet connection are unaware when the Mailboxing service is utilized because it is fast and transparent to customers. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The following diagram shows a typical Mailboxing prescriber and pharmacy message exchange used when an Internet connection is not persistent. The Prescriber System sends and retrieves messages using the Surescripts pharmacy 1 mailbox. The pharmacy 1 also sends and retrieves messages using the Surescripts pharmacy 1 mailbox. Prescribers and pharmacies can use the Mailboxing service to queue and exchange messages at their convenience without message loss. The Mailboxing service can be scaled to add mailboxes for additional customers. The example shows additional mailboxes for Pharmacy 2, 3, 4, and so on.</p>
