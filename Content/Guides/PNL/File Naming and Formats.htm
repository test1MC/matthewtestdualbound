        <p class="BodyText1">File naming convention is <span style="font-style: italic;">IMMParticipantNameYYYYMMDDXX</span> where <span style="font-style: italic;">XX</span> is a unique sequence for that day. It is strongly suggested to compress the file prior to transmitting it to Surescripts. The current zip protocols that are supported are gzip, bzip2 and zip.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">If compression is used, the archive file should contain only a single immunization file. The compressed archive file should have the same file name as the immunization file it contains, with the addition of the file extension of the compression method. </p>
        <p class="BodyText3">Example: Immunization file name: IMMAcmePharmacy2012112001.txt is then placed in a compressed archived: IMMAcmePharmacy2012112001.txt.gz</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The file should then be delivered to Surescripts using FTP and placed in the “to_surescripts” folder.</p>
