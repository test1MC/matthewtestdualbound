        <p class="BodyText1">The Surescripts Physician Notification Letters for Immunizations Implementation Guide was created to assist participants in sending immunization event data to Surescripts for reporting to patients’ primary care providers.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Participants provide Surescripts with a daily file containing information about immunizations administered at their sites. Surescripts uses the information in the file to generate and initiate delivery of physician notification letters (PNLs) to the patients’ primary care providers (PCPs) describing the immunizations administered. See <MadCap:xref href="Processing Sequence.htm">Processing Sequence on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref> for details. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The audience for this document includes any participant responsible for developing a system interface for this service. This guide describes the Surescripts Batch Immunization file format, processing flows and related details and requirements.&#160; </p>
