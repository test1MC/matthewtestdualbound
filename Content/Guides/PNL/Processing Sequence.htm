        <p class="BodyText1">The Physician Notification Letters for Immunizations product uses Surescripts Guaranteed Delivery capability to determine how letters will be routed. Guaranteed Delivery operates by matching data in the PNL record to data in the Surescripts directory and makes routing decisions through an algorithm. The Guaranteed Delivery algorithm sequences as follows:</p>

In 2014.1 we included CDA attachments in addition to PDF attachments for electronic delivery. I looked at the Implementation Guide and found only one place where a change must be made to accommodate the update. This update does not constitute a new version of PNL. We do not need to provide any additional specificity regarding the CDA attachment because we are generating it and it does not impact the implementation process.  \r\n\r\n1) Page 14, first bullet under Physician Notification Letter Delivery. \r\na. The system determines whether the primary care provider is accessible electronically. If so, it initiates an electronic message containing a PDF and a CDA of the physician notification letter. \r\n\r\nPlease make the update at your earliest convenience, I don’t think we need a formalized review process given the small change.\r\n\r\n" MadCap:editor="megan.hayden" MadCap:editDate="2016-03-24T13:28:29.7326832-05:00">of </MadCap:annotation>the physician notification letter. <br /><br />If delivery is not successful, the system attempts fax delivery.</li>
