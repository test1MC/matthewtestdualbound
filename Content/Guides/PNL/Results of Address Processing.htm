        <p class="BodyText1">The processed form of each primary care provider address is included in the response file, in addition to the address submitted in the Immunization File. Accompanying the processed address are two additional elements, one indicating whether the address was deemed to be deliverable according to CASS error processing, and another element summarizing the processing outcome.</p>

Note that a postal address error will not prevent delivery of provider notification via electronic message or secure fax. </p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Address processing summary information</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Information categorizing the outcome of address processing is provided in the PCP Address Processing Summary element. Preliminary values in the summary element include: </p>
