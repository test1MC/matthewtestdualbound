        <p class="BodyText1">Where possible, the process will combine immunization notifications in a single method (e.g. one envelope) to reduce the number of messages received by a particular provider. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="0.1.1 "><a name="_Patient_With_Multiple"></a><a name="_Toc446316804"></a>Patient With Multiple Immunizations</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">When a patient receives multiple immunizations during a single visit (or during the same day at the same care location), their immunizations will be combined into a single physician notification letter.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The number of immunizations that will fit in a single physician notification letter will depend on the space required by the participant’s standard letter content. Three immunizations can be combined into a single letter.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Immunizations will be grouped into the same letter if all of the information below is the same in the individual immunization records supplied in the Immunization File:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Source System ID + Participant’s Patient ID </li>
            <li>Patient Name</li>
            <li>Primary care provider’s NPI, name and address</li>
            <li>Care location at which the immunizations were administered</li>
            <li>Administration Date</li>
            <li>Notification Letter Configuration Code (which indicates the letter content and branding to be used).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">This grouping occurs during all delivery methods: electronic, fax, and postal mail.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="0.1.2 "><a name="_Toc446316805"></a>Provider With Multiple Immunizations</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">When multiple patients of the same provider receive immunizations on the same day, and the provider is reachable only by postal mail, multiple physician notification letters will be delivered in the same envelope.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">PNLs will be combined into the same envelope if all of the information below is the same in the individual letters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary care provider’s NPI</li>
            <li>Primary care provider’s name </li>
            <li>Primary care provider’s address</li>
            <li>Configuration code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">This grouping occurs only for postal mail delivery, and does not affect electronic or fax delivery.</p>
