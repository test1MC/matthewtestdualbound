        <p class="BodyText1">The batch immunization reporting process is available to accept and process participant files daily. The participant and Surescripts will coordinate the time window within which files may be submitted.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts will complete processing and return a response file to the participant within 24 hours of receiving the immunization file. During that time period, Surescripts will initiate delivery of a Physician Notification Letter for each immunization via electronic, fax or postal methods, or will note in the response file that delivery could not be initiated due to missing or invalid address information.</p>
