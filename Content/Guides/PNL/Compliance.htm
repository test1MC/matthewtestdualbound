        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts’ goal is efficiency and consistency across the network so that all participants can meet the highest measures of patient safety, end-to-end reliability, and quality. To ensure that participants comply with, and adhere to, the approved certification requirements, Surescripts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initiates a remediation process for identified compliance issues,</li>
            <li>Conducts scheduled and ad-hoc compliance checks of all participants transacting on the network, and</li>
            <li>Monitors participants in production to ensure all network participants remain in compliance with certification requirements and contractual terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText1">Participants agree to notify Surescripts when they have altered, reconfigured or disabled any portion of a Surescripts certified software product or module, before moving such changes into production, as they may create a circumstance of non-compliance with the Surescripts certification issued. In those instances, Surescripts will work with the participant to perform a timely re-certification, if required, to ensure network compliance and safety.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The guide is intended for certification on our network only and is not intended to ensure compliance with state and federal law. In accordance with participant’s legal agreement with Surescripts, each participant is responsible for conducting its own due diligence to ensure compliance with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, local and state laws and regulations in which the participant’s application is deployed.</p>
