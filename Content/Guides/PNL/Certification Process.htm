        <p class="BodyText1">This phase includes more detailed testing of the transactions and the user interface to ensure that all Surescripts requirements are met. You will be assigned a Certification Project Manager who will work with you through the completion of certification testing. Surescripts will provide more detail surrounding the milestones that are necessary to certify and move into production. Once a participant passes certification, services are turned on in production.</p>
