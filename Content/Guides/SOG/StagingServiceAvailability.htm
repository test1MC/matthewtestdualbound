        <p class="BodyText1" style="color: #000000;">Service availability is defined as the ability to accept messages, transactions, or files. Surescripts availability management aims to sustain availability to support customers at a justifiable cost. The high-level activities performed to realize these availability requirements include: availability planning, availability monitoring, availability reporting, change management, and communication of maintenance activities.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Availability management addresses each product and service in staging to perform at an agreed upon level over a specified period of time as measured over the twelve month period ending on the last day of the previous calendar month.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" style="color: #000000;">Availability = [(Total Time – Unplanned Downtime) /Total Time]</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" style="color: #000000;">Availability is the long-term average fraction of time that the specified Surescripts product is in service and satisfactorily performing its intended function.</p>

        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts Staging Environment is expected to be available from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM ET Monday through Friday, excluding Surescripts' holidays. Surescripts will send a Support Notification email to connected customers to notify them of a Surescripts observed holiday one week before the holiday. Surescripts will make an effort to limit service interruptions during staging business hours. Unscheduled interruptions may occur without notice.5.2 Directory Management &amp; Connectivity</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Due to performance considerations in certification suite, Surescripts recommends limiting the number of registrations per account to the directory. Surescripts reserves the right to remove directory registrations.</p>
