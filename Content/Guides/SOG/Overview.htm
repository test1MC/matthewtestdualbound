        <p class="BodyText1">This Staging Environment Operations Guide (hereafter referred to as "this document") is provided by Surescripts to customers to provide a framework to outline responsibilities, expectations, and operating principles regarding customers' interconnection to pilot, early adopter and generally available services on the Surescripts® staging environment.
