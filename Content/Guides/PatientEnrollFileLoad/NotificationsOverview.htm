        <p class="BodyText1">To change data for a patient, submit the patient in an enrollment file using the updated information for the patient.  Updates can be made to any data in the patient detail record (PMA) other than Organizational NPI, Assigning Authority, and Patient ID.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">Updates can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change of patient demographics (name fields, address fields, date of birth, gender)</li>
            <li>Adding / removing Notifications Requested for this Patient</li>

        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Deleting"></a>Deleting a Previously Enrolled Patient</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1">Technically, it is not possible to delete an enrolled patient.  However, it is possible to stop receiving notifications for a patient.  This is accomplished by updating the End Monitoring Date of the patient to the current date or a desired date in the future.   Once the update is processed by Surescripts and the date is reached, no notifications will be generated or sent for the patient.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>New patients (Assigning Authority plus Patient ID) received in an enrollment file will be validated and loaded.</li>
            <li>New recipients (Sender ID, Organizational NPI) with associated patient detail (PMA) records will be validated and loaded.</li>
            <li>A new recipient for a patient already monitored by a different recipient will be validated and loaded independently from the original recipient record.  Surescripts considers the combination of Sender ID, Organizational NPI, Assigning Authority, and Patient ID to be the unique keys to a record being monitored for notifications.</li>

            <MadCap:change MadCap:changes="11">General Message Requirements</MadCap:change>
        </h2>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="11">The message specification have been defined to allow the most effective processing.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:changes="11"><a name="UTC" MadCap:changes="11"></a>UTC Time Format</h3>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="11">By using UTC, the receiver of a message will know the time regardless of the time zone they are in. For example: If a message was sent from Boston at 5:30PM EDT (Eastern Daylight Time), the time would be sent as 21:30 UTC time. If this message was received in Chicago CDT (Central Daylight Time), the 21:30 UTC could be converted to the local CDT time of 4:30PM. Refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time" MadCap:changes="11">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time</a>, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" MadCap:changes="11">http://www.w3.org/XML/</a> for more information. Synchronize UTC time with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Drift of no more than one minute will be acceptable.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="11">When sending only a Date (not Date and Time), it should be sent in your local time zone, and the receiver should interpret it in their local time. Neither party should attempt to convert the Date to UTC.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1" MadCap:changes="11">All standard programming languages should have a function for generating a date in the UTC time zone or displaying a date in the local time zone. The format of the date/time fields in the XML schema must use the xsd:dateTime format. Examples of that format are: CCYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.FZ, where the UTC time zone may be specified as Z, + 00:00, or - 00:00. For example, 2013-01-01T16:09:04.5Z, or 2013-01-01T16:09:04.5-00:00, or 2013-01-01T16:09:04.5+00:00, where 16:09:04.5Z would be 16 hours, 09 minutes, 04 seconds, 5 fractional seconds. UTC time is denoted by either the “Z” in the first example or the “-00:00” in the second example, or the “+00:00” in the third example. The fractional seconds is not required. Refer to xsd:dateTime for more information.</p>
        <div class="note" MadCap:changes="11">
            <p MadCap:changes="11"><b MadCap:changes="11">Note</b>: For the Patient Enrollment File, the format is as follows:</p>
            <ul MadCap:changes="11">
                <li MadCap:changes="11">For Date fields the format is: CCYYMMDD</li>

        <p class="BodyText1">Surescripts will ensure that customers are in compliance with the message specifications outlined in this Guide during Integration Testing and will continue to enforce once in production.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">At a minimum, Surescripts validations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.XMLSchemaValidation">XML schema validation</li>
            <li>The sender identification and authentication</li>
