        <p class="BodyText1">When there is a patient encounter, the provider vendor should run an eligibility request/response (X12 270 and 271 messages) to obtain the Payer Identification and the PBM Unique ID needed to identify the patient. If there is no patient encounter, the demographic MPI search is used. See section Demographic MPI Search for more information.</p>
