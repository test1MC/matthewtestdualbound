        <h1 class="Heading1">Messages Overview</h1>
        <p class="BodyText1">Specialty Patient Enrollment supports the ability to communicate with pharmacies using structured FHIR® messages containing the information captured as part of the Specialty Patient Enrollment process. The content of this message is a FHIR® bundle object, where the Bundle is "message". The Bundle contains a collection of entries – a MessageHeader followed by other FHIR® objects that hold the information captured and/or sent by the provider vendor to Specialty Patient Enrollment.</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">For more information on these FHIR® structured messages, see the <a href="FHIRMessageResources.htm">FHIR® Message Resources</a> section.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Message"></a>Message Descriptions</h2>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">NewRx – New Prescription Request</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The NewRx message for Specialty Patient Enrollment will follow the NCPDP standard prescription routing requirements with the addition of requiring the &lt;TertiaryIdentifier&gt; (UIB-030-03) in the UIB – Interactive Interchange Control Header to be populated with a value of "SPO". This identifier will be used as an indicator to the pharmacy to expect an SPOEnrollmentRequest message. The &lt;PrescriberOrderNumber&gt; (UIH-030-01) in the NewRx message will be used to tie the NewRx to the SPOEnrollmentRequest.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The NewRx message flow is transmitted prior to the Specialty Patient Enrollment for Pharmacies workflow and is not included in the message flow examples below.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">SPOEnrollmentRequest</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The SPOEnrollmentRequest is sent from Surescripts to the specialty pharmacy for the enrollment of the patient that was prescribed a specialty medication. The SPOEnrollmentRequest provides the ability to communicate with pharmacies with a structured FHIR® message containing the information captured as part of the Specialty Patient Enrollment process.</p>
        <p class="StylebodytextBold">SpecialtyEnrollmentNote</p>
        <p class="BodyText1">The SpecialtyEnrollmentNote is a structured FHIR® message that is sent from the specialty pharmacy to the provider to request additional enrollment information for the patient.</p>
