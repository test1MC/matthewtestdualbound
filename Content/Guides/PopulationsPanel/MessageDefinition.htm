        <p class="BodyText1">The Panel Management RxHistory Response File is created by Surescripts and contains an NCPDP RxHistoryResponse for each patient in the Patient File that was sent by the customer. Each RxHistoryResponse contains aggregated claim and fill data for one patient. All of the RxHistoryResponses are concatenated together to create a single Response file for all patients that were listed in the corresponding patient file. There may be a maximum of two RxHistoryResponses for one patient in the case where the patient has more than 300 medication records, because there is a maximum of 300 medications that can be sent per RxHistoryResponse. The maximum number of drugs that may be sent per patient is 600. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="ProcessOverview.htm">Process Overview on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
